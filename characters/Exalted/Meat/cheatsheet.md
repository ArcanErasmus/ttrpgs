One dot in this Merit provides a relatively weak familiar,
such as a squirrel, owl, cat or dog. Two dots provides a
formidable or useful beast, such as a riding animal or
vicious predatorâ€”horses, simhata, tigers, and omen dogs
are all appropriate two-dot familiars

Nellens Atalis
- From Juche. Wealthy branch of the family, but constantly pushing to further their investments.
- Atalis was very ND, never understood human interactions.
- Her parents, Ugan and Hipebi, gave up on tutoring her, and concluding that it was too much work for too little gain, refused to have another kid. Instead they put their effort into far-fetched schemes, hoping to win big and skyrocket their relevance.
- Atalis spent her time on the streets, in between her father Ugan's brief but recurring attempts to teach her how to socialize, and her mother Hipebi's similar pushes to educate her on reading and mathematics.
- Atalis vanished for days or weeks on end, stealing food to avoid returning home, playing with animals, roughhousing with the other kids. She would climb over the walls into the neighbor's food stores to raid them at night. They were doctors, and whenever she was caught stealing, she would be punished with chores assisting in medical care, to both repay what she took and show the supposed dangers of her risky adventures.
- Hipebi led an expedition to the southlands, and Atalis was eager to join. It was a way to get out of the city, to experience nature in its glory.
- The expedition trekked deep into the Burning Sands, hunting for a First Age artifact. The lost treasure was said to grow bountiful trees bearing fruits of any type, and Hipebi hoped that it would be a source of the unimaginably valuable Divine Peaches.
- The expedition got close to where the artifact was lost, but unrest had been mounting over the continual risk. Hipebi urged the hired support staff to keep going, but without Ugan's persuasiveness, she couldn't convince them. They turned on the family in the night, taking the remaining supplies and wealth, and disappearing.
- With their means of survival cut off, Atalis knew her mother and staff would get themselves killed in their search. She heard them talk of survival, and their plans made no mention of her, only where they can supposedly find the artifact, and how to get there. Atalis heard Hipebi and one of her trusted aides discuss running ahead, just the two of them, to make better time.
- Realizing she would be abandoned by them yet again, Atalis fled into the wild, alone. She survived by foraging, and hunting small game. She had always been more in tune with nature than others gave her credit for.
- Atalis wandered further and further towards the unstable edge of Creation. Despite her best attempts to head north to the coast, her hunting drew her inland, where the rules of reality would wobble and shift.
- Her exaltation:
    - She had been changing slowly from all of the Wyld energies around.
    - She'd done it, though! She'd found this magical treebranch. It didn't do anything, but she knew the magic was there. If she brought it home, she thought, they would finally like her. They would activate it, see how powerful it was, and see her as one of their own.
    - Much time passed. The stick never produced any fruit like she thought it would. It was pretty good for hitting things, though.
    - She injures a large flightless bird and stalks it for miles.
    - The land has been getting more unstable, but she's hungry so she keeps going.
    - The bird stops to rest in some shade, but [The Woman] doesn't have any weapon anymore.
    - [The Woman] laments her mere humanity, contemplating how she could kill the bird.
    - A crocodile jumps from the shadows and snaps it up, and in that moment [The Woman] is enraptured with its strength. She feels no envy for its strength, no jealousy over it taking her kill. In that moment, she feels divinely inspired, she has seen true beauty and it's the peak of evolution, the power and unmatchable ferocity of nature, unchained by humanity.
    - Plus she knows that the bird is too big for the crocodile to eat all of, it will rip pieces off and leave the remainder, which she will feast on.
    - She waits and watches, and after it leaves she moves to take the fresh game.
    - At the same time, a pair of hyenas emerge from the brush, also having been waiting and watching. In that moment, [The Woman] knows she has to fight, she needs the food to survive.
    - She hears a whispering, not even words but impulse, feels the urge to shed her skin, to snarl, to shout, to roar, to bite and hit and not run any longer.
    - Leaping at the hyenas she tumbles to the ground with them. Where their teeth meet her flesh, she grows tough, like the crocodile. Where her teeth meet their flesh, she grows wicked fangs, like the crocodile. When they try to knock her down, she grows a tail to support herself, like the crocodile. When they are wounded, she gives them pause with a chilling, bubbling growl, like the crocodile. When they flee, she grabs one by the throat and snaps its neck with a roll, just like a crocodile would have.
    - When she feasts, the crocodile returns. She offers part of her own kill, and they eat together. As it departs, she watches its silver scales.
    - Only later does she remember the stick. It never really helped her. It never shielded her from the sun, warmed her at night, or provided any sustenance. It was her own body, her own strength, which carried her through. She doesn't feel like [The Woman] anymore. That was a name for someone dressed in people clothes, who did people activities. Her family wouldn't like what she has become. With all of her changes, she wouldn't even be a person to them. Far more important was what the critters around her saw, and to them, she was just a slab of Meat.
- Ironically, the silly stick does actually now provide shelter, warmth, and fresh fruit. She doesn't need it.
- With newfound strength and ability, she makes good time headed north. She wanted to find others like her. Besides that, there was a special call pulling her back to the Isle.
- Reaching the coast, she was able to hunt a fish and swim to the Isle.
- She made it up the Caracal River, and walked the rest of the way to Juche.
- Arriving at her family's estate, she has her SCENE.
    - Stalks in as the sun's glare barely bleeds over the horizon, still contemplating her decision. She sees Ugan, he asks about Hipebi. About the expedition.
    - She is furious that he cares at all about them. That he cares about any of the society he lives in. That he thinks she's still Atalis.
    - She smashes the staff over her knee, and throws it at his feet.
    - She walks out, leaving Ugan petrified in terror. She leaves behind her the flimsy veneer of human society, ripped away by the simplest of actions. Her old life, laughably mismatched to who she has grown into.
    - And she walks forward towards the dawn, where her heart is pulled.
