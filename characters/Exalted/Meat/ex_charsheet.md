# Custom Charms
## Claws of the Silver Moon, evocations
### Shut Up
- Cost: 2m 1wp; Mins: Essence 2
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: Withering only, Perilous
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisites: None
I hate when people complicate the truth with words. Shut up and fight me! When someone within close range tries to verbally speak, and has less initiative than me, I can reflexively make a withering attack against them. This attack does not reward me any initiative. If it hits, their words choke off after the first sound, and they cannot speak until the next round. If it crashes them, they cannot speak until they exit Initiative Crash. I can only use this evocation once per round.

## Universal
### Moon's Reflection Recast
- Cost â€”(+2m); Mins: Essence 3
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisites: Many-Faced Moon Transformation
The Lunar aches to unbind others from their static forms. When in physical contact with a willing recipient that the Lunar has a Major or Defining positive tie towards, or is her Solar Bond, she can pay a 2-Mote surcharge when activating Many-Faced Moon Transformation. Doing so makes no changes to the Lunar's appearance, but instead lets the recipient choose to alter their shape as if they had used the Charm themselves. If they decide to conceal their identity with the transformation, either the recipient or the Lunar may make the disguise roll.

## Stamina - Defense
### Guardian's Final Duty
- Cost 1m, 2i; Mins: Stamina 4, Essence 2
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: Dual, Perilous
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisites: Den Warden Method or Mother Grizzly Attitude
Grimly determined to avoid the costs of failure, the Lunar will go any length to insulate her charge from harm. When an ally the Lunar is protecting with a defend other action is hit by an attack, the Lunar may choose to take some of the damage on their behalf. For withering attacks, this transfers (her positive intimacy towards her ward plus her Essence) damage to her, and the attacker does not gain initiative for the transferred damage. For decisive attacks, this transfers (her positive intimacy towards her ward) damage, and this cannot be blocked by Hardness. In both cases, the damage she takes for her ward is the full amount, up to the damage dealt by the attack. The damage transferred may not be reduced or blocked by magic.
