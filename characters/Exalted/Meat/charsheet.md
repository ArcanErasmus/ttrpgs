### Plan for Caste
- Charisma and Intelligence
- This represents the areas where she recognizes the greatest need for growth. It would take a very long time for them to increase, but if she wants to pursue that journey the fastest, this is how. And even a small increase opens up new doors.
- Manually fudge the in-progress training times for Intelligence II and Charisma III, and refund 1 xp for Charisma III.

### New Role Bonus
- Overcoming an entrenched situation or belief in a way that reveals something new about the character or leads her to learn something about herself; advancing or protecting a Major or Defining Intimacy by her flavor of neurodivergence and issues; removing a major impediment to her or her Circle’s goals through sheer obstinance; protecting a Major or Defining Intimacy to an individual or community she's actually started to care about.

### Training Notes (Currently Resplendent Water 10, RY768)
- Resplendent Water 11, RY768 - Stamina Charm (I/I), Ox-Body Technique
- Resplendent Water 12, RY768 - Appearance Charm (II/I), Argument-Eclipsing Shadow
    *Flashback Advance: ?*
- Resplendent Water 13, RY768 - Awareness IV
    *Flashback Advance: Acclimation to an urban environment from a new angle. Predator, where she used to be prey. Hunting for angles of attack, as opposed to escape.*
- Resplendent Water 13, RY768 - Appearance Charm (III/I), Lapdog's Quiet Reign
- Resplendent Water 14, RY768 - Appearance Charm (IV/I), Perfect Symmetry
- Resplendent Water 22, RY768 - Willpower VI
    *Flashback Advance: No longer is she able to cut and run when outmatched. She has people, places, and things she needs to protect. She must stand, fight, and endure.*
- Resplendent Water 23, RY768 - Athletics IV
    *Flashback Advance: As a lone wanderer, it was fine to take the long route, to avoid obstacles. But as a pack leader, a teammate, and a petty baron, there is often little time to waste. Meat has had to go right through, and with haste, many a barrier in her path.*
- Descending Water 2, RY768 - Pain Tolerance (pp164)
    *Flashback Advance: On her own, there was no plenty, no guarantees. Many days were spent hunting while ravenous, powering through the cramps and weakness. A mere flesh wound has nothing on the hunger pangs that hollow you out and sap your strength.*
- Descending Water 9, RY768 - Presence IV
- Descending Water 21, RY768 - Intelligence II
    - is prereq for Intelligence III (12 weeks, 7 xp) (if caste: 4 weeks, 6 xp)
- Descending Water 23, RY768 - Manipulation II
- Ascending Wood 21, RY768 - Charisma III
    *Flashback Advance: Meat has finally met an obstacle she can't punch: self-expression. Replaying her argument with Scrimshaw over and over and over again in her head, she hunted for the words to make him understand her. That moment has long passed, but this time, she's more prepared to speak what she means, how she means it.*
    - is prereq for Charisma IV (16 weeks, 11 xp) (consider stunting) (if caste: 5 weeks, 9 xp)
        - is prereq for Moon-and-Earth Blessing (5 days, 9 xp) (pp177)
- Resplendent Wood 9, RY768 - Dexterity III

### BANNER EFFECTS
At dim anima, the cost of shifting into human shapes is discounted by two motes.

At bonfire anima, the cost of shifting into animal shapes is discounted by two motes. This doesn’t apply to Charms like Towering Beast Form or Emerald Grasshopper Form.

Once per day, she may use the once-per-day power of any Lunar Caste. She can’t use it again until she’s used the powers of all three Castes, or the session ends — e.g., a Casteless who uses the Full Moon power must use the Changing Moon and No Moon powers before she can use the Full Moon power again that session.

FULL MOON: Once per day, when she lands a decisive attack that resets her Initiative, she may pay 10 motes, one Willpower to roll Join Battle, adding (highest physical Attribute) non-Charm dice.

CHANGING MOON: Once per day, she can pay three motes, one Willpower when she makes an influence roll to ignore negative Ties her targets have towards her (or her current shape). These Ties can’t be used to bolster Resolve or in Decision Points.

NO MOON: Once per day, while her anima is at bonfire, she can reflexively expend it completely to either gain one Willpower, add (Essence + [highest mental Attribute]) sorcerous motes to a spell she’s shaping, or add a free full Excellency (which counts as Charm dice) on a mental Attribute-based roll other than Join Battle.
