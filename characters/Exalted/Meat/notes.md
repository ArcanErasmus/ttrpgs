# Notes
**Types of Exalts**
Solars
- mechanically simplest
- dive deep into a single area fastest

Lunars
- shapeshift into animals, can learn to shift into people
- better stats worse skills than solars (more well-rounded)

Dragon-Blooded
- existence isn't illegal in Creation
- lower power than Celestials
- elemental-themed

-- Homebrews

Abyssals
- really easy to read the document
- do everything in an evil way
- otherwise like solars

Siderials
- training rather than just given power
- illuminati
- make the world follow narrative rules
- fate

Infernals
- (talia doesn't know)
- not complete homebrew

**Basic Rules**
Rolls
- "diff" (from WoD) always 7, "diff" is now num successes needed
- some things, like Evasion, you don't roll, it's a static value

Stunting
- describe it in a cool way, get bonus based on how cool
- 1pt: +2 dice or +1 static value
- 2pt: +2 dice +1 auto success, or +2 static value, also +1 WP
- 3pt: +2 dice +2 auto success, or +3 static value, also +2 WP

Extended Actions
- like whammer, get # successes in # time

Willpower
- get WP up to max of 10 not permanent pool
- permanent pool used for some but not all rolls
- gain by sleeping or stunting
- spend for +1 auto success or +1 static value before a roll, or reject influence on intimacy

Limit
- if defy intimacies, roll dice and gain limit for successes
    - 1 die for major
    - 2 for defining
    - 3 for trigger

Experience
- type a can be spent on anything
- type b can be spent on anything except your exalt type's charms

**Combat**
Health
- same as WoD

Initiative
- roll for initiative at start when you Join Battle
- if reduced to 0 enter Initiative Crash
    - real easy to deal damage to you
    - some abilities can't be used
    - if you do hit someone when you are Crashed, you get extra initiative steal

Attacks
- withering - steal initiative from target
- decisive - turn initiative into damage
- make attack vs defenses
    - soak
    - on success, deal damage to initiatve, add damage to your own
    - when do decisive attack, roll num damage dice based on initiative

Defenses
- can Parry or Evade
- cumulative penalty for getting attacked in same turn
- Hardness is given by magic and is threshold for taking actual hits

Soak
- stam + armor bonus, reduces damage from withering attacks ONLY

Range Bands and Movement
- range bands: close, short, medium, long, extreme
- range bands are kept track of separately for different people/groups
- move action to move one band closer/further for free, more requires spending actual action

Combat Turns
- move one range band for free
- take one action
    - flurry: take 2 different actions with -3 on both rolls and -1 on defense until next turn

Actions
- Attacks
    - Clashing: if atk on same exact initiative, both roll atk opposed basically
- Aim
    - bonus to atk that target next round
    - can't aim and move, can't flurry aim
- Defend Other
    - let ally use your parry value
- Disengage
    - spend initiative to bail
- Draw Weapon
    - do that
- Full Defense
    - spend init for +def
- Gambit
    - do a special attack (lots of options)
- Rise from Prone
    - stand, need roll if opponent at close range
- Rush
    - charge opponent in short range
- Take Cover
    - +def for an attack
- Withdraw
    - run from fight

**Social Combat**
Intimacies
- what your character cares about
- can be to a person, with feeling attached
- can be to an idea
- minor: firm belief, little impact on life
- major: major aspect of personal belief system
- defining: will lay down life for

Resolve: social defense
- use this vs someone persuading you or giving you an intimacy
- based on wits + integrity + specialties
- influenced based on strongest relevant positive and negative intimacy

Actions
- Instill
    - add, strengthen, or weaken target's intimacies
    - need multiple relevant intimacies to push to higher rank
- Persuade
    - get people to do something based on intimacies
        - minor: do a favor, inconvenient or mildly dangerous, not too disruptive
        - major: change their lives, risk life or limb
        - defining: do basically anything
    - resisting persuasion with willpower requires unused conflicting intimacy
    - anti-persuading a target is hard
    - Bargaining: can also just bribe
- Threaten
    - not really an "action", just using Instill/Persuade with negative intimacies

Inspiration
- better at affecting multiple people
- you choose emotion, they choose what they do with that emotion

Read Intentions
- can find out an intimacy or spot a lie
- defended by Guile

Appearance
- if appearance > target's resolve, you get the diff on social actions
