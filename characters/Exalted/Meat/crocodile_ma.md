# Custom Charms
## Claws of the Silver Moon, evocations
### Shut Up
- Cost: 2m 1wp; Mins: Essence 2
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: Withering only, Perilous
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: None
I hate when people complicate the truth with words. Shut up and fight me! When someone within close range tries to verbally speak, and has less initiative than me, I can reflexively make a withering attack against them. This attack does not reward me any initiative. If it hits, their words choke off after the first sound, and they cannot speak until the next round. If it crashes them, they cannot speak until they exit Initiative Crash. I can only use this evocation once per round.

### Moon's Reflection Recast
- Cost â€”(+2m); Mins: Essence 3
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Many-Faced Moon Transformation
The Lunar aches to unbind others from their static forms. When in physical contact with a willing recipient that the Lunar has a Major or Defining positive tie towards, or is her Solar Bond, she can pay a 2-Mote surcharge when activating Many-Faced Moon Transformation. Doing so makes no changes to the Lunar's appearance, but instead lets the recipient choose to alter their shape as if they had used the Charm themselves. If they decide to conceal their identity with the transformation, either the recipient or the Lunar may make the disguise roll.

## Stamina - Defense
### Guardian's Final Duty
- Cost 1m, 2i; Mins: Stamina 4, Essence 2
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: Dual, Perilous
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Den Warden Method or Mother Grizzly Attitude
Grimly determined to avoid the costs of failure, the Lunar will go any length to insulate her charge from harm. When an ally the Lunar is protecting with a defend other action is hit by an attack, the Lunar may choose to take some of the damage on their behalf. For withering attacks, this transfers (her positive intimacy towards her ward plus her Essence) damage to her, and the attacker does not gain initiative for the transferred damage. For decisive attacks, this transfers (her positive intimacy towards her ward) damage, and this cannot be blocked by Hardness. In both cases, the damage she takes for her ward is the full amount, up to the damage dealt by the attack. The damage transferred may not be reduced or blocked by magic.

# Kaprosuchus Style
Gonna need like 10 charms, including a form
- Weapons: Natural weapon strikes like teeth, claws, tail strikes, lots of throws and wrestling
- Armor: All
Core bits:
- grapple with your teeth
- flip and roll with your opponent; disorient and trip
- tail slap
- ignore punishment
- rip off limbs?
- eat opponent's flesh?
- stealth in spite of penalties?
- Crush through armored soak
- bonus vs prone
- sharp sight
- auto-damage in grapple

## New Brainstorm ideas, inspired by Sect
- think of bringing Inner World into being
- bringing the edge of the wyld, your natural habitat
- "spinning the compass", disorient space itself. Gap closer? Prevent escape?
- warp the terrain 
- warp your and opponents' bodies
- DoT to both parties, "hold them under", "beyond the water's edge"?, 'if either prevent the damage it affects neither'

- Crocodile tail slap intimidation 
- Move speed

*The Book of Dread Blades - Tyrant Lizard Style (pp. 12)*
- bonus dmg against low init enemies
- free fear on hit
- bonus vs enemies with fear
    - considered to have lower init for charms
    - double 10s on dmg
    - their 1s subtract on dmg
- if moved towards target this turn, bonus
    - ess threshold successes to decisive dmg, or double (strength) 9s on atk

Here's my idea for Meat buying the MA merit:
River: Religious angle, your connection to purpose
Grace: Emotional angle, your connection to your opponent
Scrimshaw: Strategic angle, your connection to plans and executing them
Mongrel: Bloodshed is its own reward, don't overthink it
Meat: Bloodshed is it's own reward, don't overthink it, got it
