### Alchemical Allocation - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 rd
This infusion causes a pale aura to emanate from your mouth.

If you consume a potion or elixir on the round following the consumption of this infusion, you can spit it back into its container as a free action. You gain all the benefits of the potion or elixir, but it is not consumed. You can only gain the benefits of one potion or elixir in this way per use of this infusion.

### Align Weapon - transmutation [see text]
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | touch
| Target     | weapon touched or 50 projectiles (must be together)
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
*Align weapon* makes a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, as you choose. A weapon that is aligned can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures. This infusion has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment.

You can't cast this infusion on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike. When you make a weapon chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, align weapon is a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful infusion, respectively.

### Ant Haul, Communal - transmutation
| Target     | creatures touched
This infusion functions like ant haul except you may divide the duration in 2-hour intervals among the creatures touched.

### Armor Enchantment - transmutation
| Components | V,S,M (a prepared ointment costing 50 gp)
This infusion functions like *lesser armor enhancement*, except that you can select multiple armor or shield special abilities whose total market price is equal to or less than 30,000 gp.

### Bear's Endurance - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (hairs or dung from a bear)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The infusion grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

### Bull's Strength - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (hairs or dung from a bull)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The subject becomes stronger. The infusion grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier.

### Bullet Ward - abjuration
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (one to four adamantine bullets, each worth 61gp)
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 10 mins/lvl or until discharged
You toss several adamantine bullets into the air, which then hover protectively nearby and intercept firearm attacks targeting you. The number of bullets protecting you is equal to half your caster level (maximum 4). When an opponent takes a shot at you with a firearm, as an immediate action you can designate a hovering bullet to attempt to block the attack, increasing your AC against that attack by 10. Doing this destroys the adamantine bullet whether or not the attack hits. The infusion is discharged when all affected adamantine bullets are destroyed or taken from you. Each adamantine bullet has AC 24, 20 hit points, and hardness 20.

### Cat's Grace - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (pinch of cat fur)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The transmuted creature becomes more graceful, agile, and coordinated. The infusion grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, adding the usual benefits to AC, Reflex saves, and other uses of the Dexterity modifier.

### Chill Metal - transmutation [cold]
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | close
| Target     | metal equipment of one creature/2lvl, or 25 lbs/lvl metal, none of any of which can be more than 30 ft apart
| Duration   | 7 rds
| Save       | Will neg (obj)
| SR         | yes (obj)
*Chill metal* makes metal extremely cold. It has the following effects:
- Unattended, non-magical metal gets no saving throw.
- Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the infusion.
- An item in a creature's possession (not "unattended") uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing or wielding such an item.

On the first round of the infusion, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the infusion's duration. During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below.

Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the infusion (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Underwater, *chill metal* deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it float if unattended.

*Chill metal* counters and dispels *heat metal*.

| Rd  | Temp | Dmg |
|-----|------|-----|
| 1   | Cold | --  |
| 2   | Icy  | 1d4 |
| 3-5 | Frz  | 2d4 |
| 6   | Icy  | 1d4 |
| 7   | Cold | --  |

### Construct Essence, Lesser - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | living construct touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
This infusion only works on constructs with the living construct subtype. The touched living construct gains low-light vision and immunity to disease, fatigue, nausea, non-lethal damage, sickened, and stunning effects.

*Lesser construct essence* counters and is countered by *lesser humanoid essence*. *Lesser construct essence* automatically fails when cast on a living construct that is under the effect of *humanoid essence* or *greater humanoid essence*.

### Destabilize Powder - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a few drops of liquor)
| Range      | close
| Target     | 1 loaded firearm
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
This infusion makes the ammunition in the target firearm is prone to misfire. Increase the misfire range by 1 + 1 per five caster levels (maximum +5) for the ammunition currently loaded into that firearm. If aware of this infusion's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 17 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.

### Eagle's Splendor - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (feathers or droppings from an eagle)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The infusion grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this infusion do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this infusion's effect do increase.

### Effortless Armor - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
Armor you wear no longer reduces your speed. You also reduce the armor's armor check penalty by 1 + 1 per five caster levels (maximum 5).

### Fox's Cunning - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (hairs or dung from a fox)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The target becomes smarter. The infusion grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence) affected by this infusion do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this infusion's effect do increase. This infusion doesn't grant extra skill ranks.

### Heat Metal - transmutation [fire]
This infusion works like *chill metal*, except it causes metal objects to become red-hot, and deal fire damage. If cast underwater, *heat metal* deals half damage and boils the surrounding water.

*Heat metal* counters and dispells *chill metal*.

| Rd  | Temp | Dmg |
|-----|------|-----|
| 1   | Warm | --  |
| 2   | Hot  | 1d4 |
| 3-5 | Sear | 2d4 |
| 6   | Hot  | 1d4 |
| 7   | Warm | --  |

### Humanoid Essence, Lesser - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | construct touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg
| SR         | no
This infusion only works on constructs. The touched construct gains the ability to be healed, at half effectiveness, by spells of the conjuration (healing) subschool. If the construct has the living construct subtype, it receives full benefit from spells of the conjuration (healing) subschool instead. Because this infusion is specifically designed to work on constructs, it bypasses the typical immunity to magic that most golems have since spell resistance does not apply.

*Lesser humanoid essence* counters and is countered by *lesser construct essence*. *Lesser humanoid essence* automatically fails when cast on a living construct that is under the effect of *construct essence* or *greater construct essence*.

### Inflict Moderate Damage - transmutation
This infusion functions like *inflict light damage*, except that you deal 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

### Improve Trap - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 min
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one trap
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
When this infusion is cast upon a trap, it improves one specific element of the trap chosen at the time of casting. The caster can improve the trap in any of the following ways (each one raises the trap's CR by +1).
- Increase DC of the Perception check required to locate the trap by +5.
- Increase DC of the Disable Device check required to disarm trap by +5.
- Increase the trap's attack bonus or saving throw by +2.

To cast this on a trap, you must know that the trap exists and its precise location. A trap can only have one improvement from this infusion at a time. A second casting changes the improvement on the trap, but does not add another improvement.

### Lucky Blade - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 rd
| Components | S,M (a two-headed coin)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | melee weapon touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl or until discharged
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
By touching a melee weapon and imbuing it with distortions of fate, the wielder of the weapon can reroll any one attack roll or confirmation roll made with that weapon before the result is determined. The wielder must take the result of the second roll, even if it worse. This infusion cannot be cast on natural weapons unless that natural weapon is of a construct creature, in which case, it applies to only one specific natural attack (such as bite or the left slam attack). Once this benefit has been used, the effect immediately ends.

### Magic Siege Engine - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | touch
| Target     | siege engine touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
This infusion permits an indirect fire siege engine to bombard its targets with greater accuracy, delivering more damage. The siege weapon receives a +1 enhancement bonus on targeting rolls and damage rolls. If used on a direct fire siege weapon, this infusion acts as *magic weapon*.

### Mask Dweomer, Communal - illusion (glamer)
| Target     | creatures or objects touched
This infusion functions like mask dweomer, except you divide the duration in 1-day increments among the creatures or objects touched.

### Masterwork Transformation - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 hr
| Components | V,S,M (see text)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | weapon, suit of armor, shield, tool, or skill kit touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You convert a non-masterwork item into its masterwork equivalent. A normal sword becomes a masterwork sword, a suit of leather armor becomes a masterwork suit of leather armor, a set of thieves' tools becomes masterwork thieves' tools, and so on. If the target object has no masterwork equivalent, the infusion has no effect. You can affect 50 pieces of ammunition as if they were one weapon. You decide if the object's appearance changes to reflect this improved quality.

The material component for the infusion is magical reagents worth the cost difference between a normal item and the equivalent masterwork item (typically 300 gp for a weapon, 150 gp for armor, or 50 gp for a tool). If an object has multiple masterwork options (such as a double weapon, or a spiked shield that could be made masterwork as a weapon or armor), you choose one option of the object to affect (though you can cast the infusion again to affect another option).

### Owl's Wisdom - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (feathers or dropping from an owl)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The infusion grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefits to Wisdom-based skill checks. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive owl's wisdom do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase.

### Ray of Retaliation - abjuration [force]
| Casting    | 1 immediate action
| Components | S
| Range      | see text
| Target     | see text
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You can only cast this infusion if you are successfully hit by a ranged touched attack defined as a ray effect (*ray of enfeeblement*, *scorching ray*, etc) and you are aware of the ray before it hits (i.e. not flat-footed). As an immediate action, you channel a small amount of force back at the caster or manifester of the original effect. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack of your own and this infusion is subject to spell resistance. If successful, you deal 1d4 points of force damage per 2 caster levels, to a maximum of 5d4. The range of this infusion is the same range as the original ray that struck you. You may not target anyone but the original caster or manifester of the ray that struck you.

### Reinforce Armaments, Communal
| Target     | armor suits or weapons touched
This infusion functions like reinforce armaments, except you divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the objects touched.

### Reinforce Construct - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | construct touched
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | no
This infusion provides the touched construct a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 points + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10). Given that this infusion was originally designed to work on golems, spell resistance does not apply.

### Reloading Hands - conjuration (creation)
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | projectile weapon touched
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
Once per round, phantom hands load a single ranged weapon or firearm with conjured ammunition. This ammunition counts as magical for overcoming damage reduction and attacking incorporeal creatures, but is the standard for its type (a normal bullet or pellets and black powder in the case of firearms). Conjured ammunition ceases to exist 1 round after it is removed from the weapon, or at the end of the duration, whichever comes first.

### Repair Moderate Damage - transmutation
This infusion functions like *repair light damage*, except that it cures 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

### Ricochet Shot - evocation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a wishbone)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one projectile weapon
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl or until discharged
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
You imbue a projectile weapon with the ability to ricochet any projectiles that hit one target so that they also hit another. When the wielder ricochets a projectile, she selects a primary target to attack. If she hits the primary target, the projectile ricochets instead of being destroyed. The wielder can then select a secondary target that is within 20 feet of the primary target. She makes an attack roll against the secondary target at the same base attack bonus, but does not gain the benefit from any enhancement bonuses or magic qualities on the projectile. If the shot comes from a firearm, the ricochet targets normal AC rather than touch AC. While the infusion lasts, the target weapon's wielder can ricochet one projectile per three caster levels you possess, to a maximum of six at caster level 18th. Once the target weapon's wielder ricochets that many shots, the infusion is discharged. If the weapon's wielder fails to use all the ricochets before the infusion end, those ricochets are wasted.

### Stabilize Powder - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a few drops of liquor)
| Range      | close
| Target     | 1 loaded firearm
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
Ammunition currently loaded in the target firearm is less prone to misfire. Decrease the misfire range by 1 + 1 per five caster levels (maximum +5, minimum misfire 0) for the ammunition currently loaded into that firearm.

### Swift Ready - conjuration (teleportation)
| Casting    | 1 minute
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | up to 3 items touched
| Duration   | 24 hrs or until discharged
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
When you can this infusion, you can touch up to three unattended items; one suit of armor or clothes and two items that can be wielded in one hand each. These one-handed items can be shields, weapons, wands or any other item that and can be carried or, in the case of weapons, wielded in one hand. You can choose to forgo the two one-handed items for a single two-handed item. A container can be targeted as a single item (one or two handed, based on its size) and encompasses whatever is in that item at the time that the infusion is cast.

At any point in time during the next 24 hours, you can, as a swift action, cause all of these targeted items to teleport to your person simultaneously, appearing in your hands or, in the case of armor or containers, on your person instantly and in the correct position. These items must be on the same plane as you and must still be unattended when you activate this part of the infusion. Attempts to summon items that are not on the same plane or are attended cause that particular item not to appear. Items placed in targeted containers after the original casting of this infusion do not get brought along. If the container holds an extradimensional space, such as a *bag of holding*, any item that was placed in it after the original casting of the infusion and still is in the container when it is summoned is lost forever in the Ethereal Plane. Regardless of how many items are successfully summoned, using this part of the infusion immediately ends the infusion's duration.

### Telekinetic Assembly - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 min
| Components | V,S,F (a minifig of the target siege engine, cost 10gp)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one disassembled siege engine
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You assemble a siege engine, using up to one fewer worker per two caster levels you possess. You can do without one additional worker if you have any ranks in Knowledge (engineering), plus one additional worker per 5 ranks you have in that skill. If your caster level combined with Knowledge (engineering) fails to eliminate the need for workers, this infusion fails.

### Toughen Construct - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | construct touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This infusion functions like *barkskin*, except that it only applies to creatures of the construct type.

### Transmute Potion to Poison - transmutation [poison]
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 rd then 1 min/lvl (see text)
This infusion causes you to take on a pale, sickly pallor for 1 round. During this time, if you consume a potion, it has no effect. Instead, your mouth fills with a vile poison that you can spit onto a weapon as a free action. If you do not spit out the poison in 1 round, it affects you instead. The effect of the poison depends on the level of spell contained in the potion consumed (see below). If the poison is not used within 1 minute per caster level it becomes inert. You can only create one dose of poison in this way per casting of this infusion.

Transmuted Poisons
0-Level Potion Poison
Type poison, injury; Save Fortitude DC 10; Frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; Effect 1 Dex damage; Cure 1 save

1st-Level Potion Poison
Type poison, injury; Save Fortitude DC 11; Frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; Effect 1d2 Dex damage; Cure 1 save

2nd-Level Potion Poison
Type poison, injury; Save Fortitude DC 13; Frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; Effect 1d4 Str damage; Cure 1 save

3rd-Level Potion Poison
Type poison, injury; Save Fortitude DC 14; Frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; Effect 1d4 Con damage; Cure 2 consecutive saves

### Unseen Crafter - conjuration (creation)
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | one invisible, mindless, shapeless servant
| Duration   | 1 day/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This infusion acts as *unseen servant* with the following changes. The servant is skilled in and comes equipped with the necessary tools for a single Craft skill, chosen at the time of casting. The skill modifier for this Craft skill is equal to your caster level plus your spellcasting attribute. The *unseen crafter* can take 10 on Craft checks and can be assigned to work more quickly, as per the Craft rules. It also does not tire, allowing it work for 24 hours per day, tripling the rate of work. However, it is not quiet, thus sleeping while it is working requires it to be far enough away to not hear it.

*Unseen crafters* do have a few significant downfalls that prevent them from replacing the common workforce. Once a task has been given, it cannot be changed or repeated. Likewise, the *unseen crafter* infusion ends when the work is finished or is otherwise not capable of being finished. Lastly, any attempt to interfere, no matter how minor, with the work of an *unseen crafter* causes the entire project to fail and ruins all of the raw materials unless the caster is present to end the infusion prematurely, as the *unseen crafter* will continue attempting to work under the false assumption that some other key part is finished.

*Unseen crafters* used to repair constructs or humanoids with the living construct subtype get a +10 circumstance bonus to the check. *Unseen crafters* do not use any tools other than the ones that were created with them and are not intelligent, thus do not gain benefits from competence, luck, morale, profane or sacred bonuses or circumstance bonuses from tools (but they do gain circumstance bonuses from other sources).

### Unseen Engineers - conjuration (creation)
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (materials required to construct the trap)
| Range      | long
| Effect     | a team of tiny, invisible engineers
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You conjure an invisible team of tiny engineers to construct a trap at alarming speed. Originating at your location, the team must remain within range of you or the infusion ends. The engineers construct a mechanical trap of your choice. Construction takes a number of rounds equal to the trap's CR. The engineers must have the materials available. At the end of the construction time, use your Craft(traps) skill with a +5 bonus to determine the success of their work. If the engineers succeed, the trap is complete and the infusion ends. If they fail, the materials are deposited at that location and the infusion ends. If the infusion's duration ends before the trap is complete, the engineers automatically fail.

The engineers move at your base speed and can carry only materials required in the construction of the desired trap. They can't attack in any way or be killed, and dissipate if they take 12 points of damage from area attacks (they get no saves against attacks).

### Versatile Weapon - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (iron filings)
| Range      | close
| Target     | weapon touched or 50 projectiles (must be together)
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
You transform the physical makeup of a weapon as you desire.

This infusion functions like *greater magic weapon*, except that it subtly alters the physical properties of a weapon, enabling it to bypass damage reduction of one the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, piercing, silver, or slashing. The affected weapon still inflicts damage of its normal type and its hardness and hit points are unchanged. This infusion can be cast on a natural weapon or unarmed strike.

### Weapon Augmentation, Lesser - transmutation
| Components | V,S,M (a prepared ointment costing 20 gp)
| Target     | weapon touched or 50 pieces of ammo within 30 ft
This infusion functions like *personal weapon enhancement*, except you can apply it to any weapon, not just your own, or up to 50 pieces of ammunition, provided that they are all of the same type and within 30 ft of each other. The special abilities chosen do not disappear when the caster is no longer holding it.
