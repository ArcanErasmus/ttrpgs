## Charms

#### Heart-Stopping Glance
- Cost: 5m, 1wp; Mins: Presence 5, Essence 5
- Type: Simple
- Keywords: Decisive-only
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Soul-Flaying Gaze x2, Hands and Blades Tied
- As a victim meets the Abyssal's eyes, he sees her full, unimaginable beauty for just an instant. The shock of that glorious moment is enough to make most immediately pass on, completely contented, to their next incarnation.
- While at 15+ Initiative, the Abyssal makes a decisive attack through Soul-Flaying Gaze. Unlike most such attacks, this does count as seductive influence (or threatening if she is Hideous), and can therefore benefit from Death's Alluring Face. Her base damage is increased by her Appearance, and for every two bonus dice she would have gained from high Appearance over her target's Resolve, she doubles one number on damage. For instance, if she would have gained four or five dice she doubles 9s.
- Outside of combat, the Abyssal can use this Charm against a trivial combatant to kill him instantly. Doing so is not immediately apparent as an attack, though the fact that he spent his last moments staring at the Abyssal might draw suspicion.



## Intimacies

## Sorcery
### Control Spells
#### Death of Obsidian Butterflies
Cost: 15sm, 1wp
Keywords: Decisive-only, Perilous
Duration: Instant
Sculpting Essence into volant black glass, the sorcerer unleashes a cascade of
obsidian butterflies. She rolls (Perception + Occult) as an undodgeable
decisive attack applied in a line against enemies out to medium range. This
line is wide enough to strike all opponents within the width of a single range
band and reaches high enough to strike aerial enemies who are at short range
to the ground (medium range enemies in the air can still be targeted by
directing the butterflies to fly along an upward path, rather than a
horizontal one). Battle groups are especially vulnerable to being cut down by
this spell, taking a -2 penalty to Defense against it.
The attack deals raw damage equal to the sorcerer's (Essence + extra successes),
or (Essence + Occult + extra successes) against a battle group. It does not
reset the sorcerer to base Initiative. Scenery made of wood, glass, or other
fragile materials is generally destroyed. After this spell has been cast, the
obsidian butterflies fall to the ground and shatter, creating terrain that may
be hazardous for barefooted characters to traverse—treat as an environmental
hazard inflicting two dice of lethal damage, difficulty 2 to resist with a
(Dexterity + Athletics) roll, and if the character is barefoot, difficult
terrain as well. Any character wearing armored boots can generally ignore the
debris.
A sorcerer who knows Death of Obsidian Butterflies as her control spell gains
(Essence) bonus dice to the spell's attack roll. When her emotions run hot,
butterfly silhouettes rise from her shadow. When she is angry, her fingernails
turn to sharp volcanic glass, making it possible to cut cloth or paper, rend
wood or flesh and other similar stunts.
#### Blood Lash
Cost: 10sm, 1lhl, 1wp
Keywords: None
Duration: Until dismissed
The sorcerer scourges her spirit with a masochistic invocation, forcing blood
from her open wounds to coalesce into a scarlet whip tipped with black barbs.
The whip has direlash traits (ACC +5, DMG +10, DEF +0, OVW 3; Tags: Lethal,
Melee, Natural, Disarming, Grappling, Flexible, Reaching). She halves wound
penalties, rounded down, when attacking, grappling, or parrying with it. This
spell's health-level cost is waived if the sorcerer has any non-bashing damage
in her health track.
The lash gains additional powers as the sorcerer's wound penalty rises:
- −1: Whipped Dog Infliction (3m; Reflexive; Instant): After damaging an enemy, the sorcerer reflexively rolls a threaten action against him. Wound penalties don't apply to it; they're instead converted to bonus dice.
- −2: Endless Crimson Coils (5m; Supplemental; Instant; Uniform): The lash extends to attack out to short range. If the sorcerer grapples an enemy at range, she may pull him to close range or leave him where she is. If she chooses the latter, an ally can free the grappled character from the clinch with a difficulty 3 gambit.
- −4: Bloodthirsty Scarlet Serpent (5m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; Decisive-only): The sorcerer makes a decisive attack as the blood lash grows a terrible fanged maw, draining her victim's vitality. She heals a level of non-aggravated damage for every 3 levels of damage dealt to a living nontrivial enemy, minimum 1. Waive Endless Crimson Coils' and Whipped Dog Infliction's costs. This power can only be used once per scene, unless reset by taking 7+ levels of decisive damage.
A sorcerer with this as her control spell may manipulate her own shed blood.
She can control any blood she sheds until it dries, causing it to move as she
wills. Using the blood to assist in actions provides exceptional equipment
bonuses (Exalted, p. 580). The blood can rarely attempt rolls by itself, but
if the Storyteller deems it possible, the sorcerer rolls normally. This power
has no range limit, but the sorcerer's senses aren't extended through her
blood.
Distortion (Goal Number: 10): The blood lash congeals, inflicting bashing
damage instead of lethal, and losing the Flexible tag. The sorcerer's wound
penalty is treated as one lower for purposes of the lash's powers.
### Shaping Rituals
#### Darkness of the Shadowlands
The sorcerer draws power from shadow and darkness, weaving it into her spells.
Whenever she begins a scene in darkness or shadow heavy enough to qualify as
concealment for attempting stealth, she gains three sorcerous motes, which
last until the end of the scene and can be spent towards any spells she casts.
Additionally, whenever she takes a shape sorcery action to shape a spell while
in stealth, she gains an additional sorcerous mote as long as the spell's
target is unaware of her. She also receives these benefits while under the
night sky during the new moon or Calibration, even without being concealed.
#### Dreams of a Long-Ago Initiation
When the sorcerer sleeps, her player may describe the fragmented visions of
her forgotten past that she dreams about. She recovers no Willpower from
sleep, instead rolling (Wits + Occult) and gaining one sorcerous mote per
success. These motes last until the next time she sleeps, and can be spent
towards any spell she casts. If the sorcerer spends all of the sorcerous motes
granted by a dream casting her control spell, each counts as two motes towards
meeting the spell's cost. Once per story, the sorcerer's player may stunt to
describe her sudden recollection of an event like the current situation, which
she resolved with sorcery. Doing so awards her a number of sorcerous motes
equal to (her Essence x [stunt level + 1]), which last for the duration of the
scene.
