## Class Features
### Favored Weapon Group (Ex)
At 1st level, the grand champion selects a group of weapons (from the fighter's list of weapon groups for the weapon training ability) to act as their favored weapons. If a grand champion has a feat that applies to one of these weapons (such as Weapon Focus), it applies to all the weapons in the group.

### Prowess (Ex)
At 1st level, the grand champion gains a +1 bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. Additionally, the grand champion gains 1 extra hit point at every level, and counts as having the Toughness feat for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

### Weapon Advantage (Ex)
At 2nd level and every even level thereafter, the grand champion can select one of the following advantages. Their effects stack.
- Add one weapon to the weapon champion’s list of favored weapons.
- +1 to confirm critical threats with favored weapons.
- +1 to CMB for disarm, sunder, and trip attacks made with favored weapons.
- +1 to CMD against disarm, steal, and sunder maneuvers against favored weapons.
- +1 to Intimidate checks made while armed with a favored weapon.

### Exercise
At 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the grand champion increases their Strength, Dexterity, or Consitution by +1. However, a character cannot select the same bonus from this class feature twice in a row. This addition is treated the same as the ability score increases all characters receive at 4th level and every 4 levels after that.

### Uncanny Dodge (Ex)
At 2nd level, a grand champion gains the ability to react to danger before their senses would normally allow them to do so. They cannot be caught flat-footed, nor do they lose their Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. They still lose their Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A grand champion with this ability can still lose their Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against them.

If a grand champion already has uncanny dodge from a different class, they automatically gain improved uncanny dodge (see the barbarian class feature) instead.

### Armored Swiftness (Ex)
At 2nd level, a grand champion moves faster in medium and heavy armor. When wearing medium or heavy armor, a grand champion can move 5 feet faster than normal in that armor, to a maximum of their unencumbered speed.

### Weapon Dominance (Ex)
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the grand champion may select one weapon dominance. Each dominance may be selected up to two times. Their effects stack.
- +1 to attacks and damage with favored weapons.
- +1 shield bonus to AC when armed with a favored weapon.
- Increase the damage the weapon deals on a critical hit. Weapons with a x2 critical multiplier deal an additional +1d4 damage. Weapons with a x3 multiplier deal an additional +1d6 damage. Weapons with a x4 or greater critical multiplier deal an additional +1d8 damage. This additional damage is added after the weapon’s critical multiplier is applied to its base damage. The damage is of the same type that the weapon that deals normally.
- +1 to Will saves made while armed with a favored weapon.

### Practice
At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the grand champion gains a bonus feat. This feat cannot grant the grand champion any benefit to spellcasting, spell-like or supernatural abilities, or Int-, Wis-, or Cha-based skills or ability checks.

### Armored Flexibility (Ex)
Starting at 5th level, a grand champion learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever they are wearing armor, they reduce the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by their armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum of a –4 reduction to the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed.

In addition, the grand champion can also move at their normal speed while wearing medium armor. At 9th level, they can move at their normal speed while wearing heavy armor.

### Legendary Physique (Ex)
Beginning at 11th level, a grand champion's honed musculature allows them to function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever the grand champion is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier to CMB or CMD, they are treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to them. They are also considered to be one size larger when determing whether a creature's special attacks based on size (such as grab or swallow whole) can affect them. These benefts stack with other effects that change the subject's size category.

### Indestructible (Ex)
At 20th level, the grand champion gains complete immunity to critical hits and sneak attacks while they are wearing armor. In addition, unless their armor has the fragile armor quality, it cannot be sundered while they are wearing it.
