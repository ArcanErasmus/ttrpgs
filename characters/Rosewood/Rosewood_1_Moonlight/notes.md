## What Rosewood Wants In The Garden Dimension And Beyond
<!-- 1. Some creatures to eat for essences and general meals -->
<!-- 2. Get into fights for achievment feat progress
    - Take damage
    - Kill Small or smaller creatures -->
3. Reinforce four-mirror armor into breastplate/agile (nonmetal if possible)
    - Add armor spikes!
<!-- 4. Acquire heavy shield -->
5. Earn any amount of money ever?
    - Alternately, magic items (most wondrous items actually suck for me)
