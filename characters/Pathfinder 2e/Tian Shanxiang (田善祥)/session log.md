    - There are a pair of giant centipedes fighting in the courtyard

    - We take out the centipedes and defend against more that arrive right behind us
- Discussing our next moves
    - Jubei is here too, she wasn't able to get to her tower, the centipedes followed her back
    - Damihansig explains that attacks started last night at the end of the festival
    - Many people died, but the gecko spirit manifested to guard The Hand
        - They still can't handle any larger attack, and really need to get out before nightfall

        - The monsters had trained serpents, were defeated but 2 people were bitten by snakes and died
