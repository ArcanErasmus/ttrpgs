## Townsfolk
- Heh Shan-Bao, male human governor
    - *Opinion: I approve of him far more than the previous ones. We speak regularly, but it's more of a business relationship. I see him as my boss, as he controls the stipend that I run my daycare on. I worry that ingratiating myself too much could lead to the townsfolk turning against me if his rule becomes tyrannical.*
    - Appointed administrator of Willowshore
- Hu Ban-niang, female human retired guard captain
    - *Opinion: We don't interact, and I keep it that way. She is not a good woman, and I look forward to her passing. She's merely a more refined bandit.*
    - Known as "Granny" Hu
    - Local crime boss and blackmailer
- Yong Wu-Xiu, female kitsune blacksmith
    - *Opinion: We talk sometimes! She's not much further than the shrine to Abadar, and I occasionally send gifts with Xiuhua.*
    - Ironworks inherited from father about a decade ago
    - `Xiuhua` helps her out around the forge frequently
- Kum Soon-shong, male human veterinarian
    - *Opinion: I've taken the kids by on more than one occasion.*

    - *Opinion: What a cute tyke! Obviously gets his big heart from his father, hopefully he grows up just as sweet.*
    - Affable attitude, compassion for animals
    - Teenager
- You So-Jin, female elf herbalist
    - *Opinion: I go there to get more herbs, and to pay my respect to the dead. We settled here at around the same time, so our conversations are often on old town history. It's jarring, however, to go from being "Miss Xiang" or "Granny Xiang" to "Young Shanxiang" around her, so we don't talk very often.*
    - Former pilgrim who frequented the Tan Sugi monastery
    - Settled here after monastery's collapse
    - `Xiuhua` spends much of her time here learning alchemy
- "Old" Matsuki Shou, male human carpenter
    - *Opinion: It's amusing how young the "elders" are. Do people call me "Old Miss Xiang" behind my back? He's a real go getter, though a bit of a stick in the mud traditionalist. I never got to know him well when he was younger, and now that I'm not nervous about being an 'outsider', his time is running out.*
    - Spokesman for the Southbank faction
    - Former apprentice of the head carpenter of the Tan Sugi monastery
    - Led his family in constructing a large estate
- Mother Otis, genderfluid half-elf innkeeper
    - *Opinion: Great sense of humor. I'm still a little leery of to visit her too often, lest parents think I'm a bad influence on the kids. I once threatened to raise a stink on his behalf, but luckily it didn't come to that.*
    - Runs the Thrice-Blessed Inn
- Choe Chung-hu, male human miller
    - *Opinion: A sweetheart. I'm more than happy to be a reliable and easy customer, and offer generous barter where I can afford it. The kids love to come along, because buying grain means it's bread baking day.*
    - Leader of the millers
    - Well-liked, keeps morale high and jobs stable
    - Offers midnight snacks
- Ba-Ming Ouh, female human priest
    - *Opinion: My heart weeps for her treatment, and I thank Daikitsu for sheltering her. She spent a significant amount of time in my classes while her relatives got things situated for her, though I haven't visited the Shrine more than a couple times.*
    - Family was rounded up for execution by the corrupt guard
    - Was hid as a baby in the Nine Ear Shrine by her mother
    - Foxes surrounded the shrine to protect her from the guards until she could be rescued
    - Wishes to return life debt by serving Daikitsu, generally supported by Willowshorers
- Elizeth Candora, female human cleric
    - *Opinion: We have beef. Her inexperienced, cloistered schooling of Bulan has resulted in unnecessary educational and social deficiencies. Candora's stubborn refusal to allow young Bulan a more varied life experience is the mark of a paranoid and uppity guardian. It's one thing to fear a child falling in with a bad crowd, but it's altogether counterproductive to avoid letting her go to school!*
    - Second-generation Taldan from Goka
    - Current priestess of the cathedral of Pharasma
    - Visited Willowshore and Tan Sugi monastery as a child
    - Plays flute in the graveyard often to soothe recently-buried spirits

Kwaka especially has my respect for keeping a level head and an open heart. And besides, I love to chat about books!*
    - Senior bookmaker
    - Leads meetings with the laborers to discuss how they should negotiate with the governor
        - Some want to go home, others want fairer pay

    - *Opinion: Theater! Love some good entertainment. I haven't exactly connected with him personally though.*
    - Runs the Seven-Colored Songbird theater
- Nadoya Sanmi, female human family matriarch
    - *Opinion: She is so much better at bargaining, I suspect the only reason I don't get overcharged is because of the kids that depend on me, like her grandkids. She's got a really nice voice.*
    - Runs Treesparrow's Rest, a grocery store
- De-Ge Hua, male halfling bathhouse owner
    - *Opinion: It's nice that we finally have a bathhouse. I don't know much about him.*

    - Well known for his obsession with cleanliness
- Luo Xi Yang, female human lawyer

    - Helped Mother Otis save the Inn from being shut down
- Yun Mong-Un, female human woodcarver

    - Skilled at her work
    - Wishes she was a painter or jewelry maker
- Huo Tian-Zhe, male human inventor

He's going to make a great father one day. He basically remade my custom armor and shields, and did a fantastic job at it. I'm not sure when I'll use them, but it cost me nothing to trade some old furniture from the estate.*
    - From Karahai (nearest settlement to the east), arrived about five years ago with his father
    - Humbled by skills of local blacksmiths, named shop "Second Best" to remind himself of it
    - Knowledge of machinery led to being asked to take over maintenance of the dam
- Damihansig Mababangloob, male human doctor
    - *Opinion: We talk a lot! He's close by, and it's nice to have someone to talk advanced medicine with. I've been studying surgical practice from him in my off time, and he's leant me multiple books to read. A very generous man. A very pleasing face to look at, too.*
    - Known locally as "Dami", is charitable
- Kim Gu-won, male human cleric
    - *Opinion: I don't head down to the Exchange very often, so I don't know what he's like. I don't hear complaints from the townsfolk, though.*

    - Premier fish keeper for her ability to sense weather changes
- Rajul Samudra, male nagaji shipwright
    - *Opinion: I assume he knows his stuff. I don't head to the docks very frequently, and the rowboat didn't have enough damage to require a proper shipwright.*
    - Hired by the Ceiba-Duyue Exchange to manage the docks, because of his boatbuilding skills
- Luda Bama, female halfling smuggler
    - *Opinion: I do not like those who traffic in poisons and drugs. I refuse to get a tattoo from someone so disreputable! After buying mushrooms there once, I've never been back. I wish she stuck to honest trade, and I'm certainly never bringing the kids here.*
    - Elderly but spry
    - Runs The Mushroom House with explicit permission from Granny Hu
- Mountain Summit Grass, agender leshy teamaker

### Birth and early life
Born Tian Sanniang (田三娘, "Third Sister") in 6950 IC (4450 AR) to peasant farmers, she grew up with a busy mother and a father who had passed just after her birth. With her older sister having already moved out (and the first didn't survive infancy), Sanniang was often left to her own devices. She got into lots of trouble.

Sanniang spent time getting into fights on the street, and poorly attempting to snatch purses. She was picked up by some toughs to act as hired muscle, but her scrawny and unintimidating nature did not lend itself to preventing fights from breaking out.

Deciding she needed to leave town, where she was increasingly disliked and useless, Sanniang and her sparse few non-enemies (calling them "friends" would be a stretch) formed a bandit group in 6981 IC. They trekked between towns, attacking and slaughtering traveling wagons for money and valuables.

After jumping a wagon that included a young child, Sanniang's buried moral qualms resurfaced with a vengance. No longer were her targets merely faceless wealthy travelers best parted from their money. One of her companions killed the child without hesitation, and Sanniang quietly split from the group in the night, in 6989 IC.

After struggling through various unskilled labor jobs, Sanniang found herself in a similar line of work to before. An adventuring group, with the key difference being that they accepted only honest and law-abiding jobs. Sanniang would stay with this group for several years, from 7001 to 7006 IC, until her dissatisfaction with the career grew too much to bear. Their regular tasks were monster hunting and ruin scavenging, neither of which made any lasting impact on the world. And further, injuries were mounting. She had seen multiple deaths and many retired from lingering damage. It came to a head when she realized that she would be likely to reach the end of her first century at the current rate. After bringing up her concerns to the group, they parted ways amicably.

Feeling disheartened, Sanniang returned home to see her mother. There, she found that her mother had been flourishing, having discovered a knack for plant magic. With her farming mostly taking care of itself, Sanniang's mother had become a popular social figure around town. She had immersed herself in multiple hobbies and social circles, and was a minor political figure. Their reunion was heartfelt, with her mother very happy to see that Sanniang was still alive. However, though her mother tried to dote on her, there was a large disconnect between them. Sanniang immersed herself in her studies, but struggled to connect to the different person her mother now was, and couldn't make meaningful inroads with her social life. With her feet back on the ground and a growing ennui, Sanniang departed from home in 7026 IC. She would remain on much closer terms with her mother, and send letters regularly from towns she passed through.

Sanniang bounced between towns across Shenmen for a few decades, looking for her dream job. Something that would last longer than a scant handful of years, and let her make a permanent change for the better. Most gigs were too short, and the potential opportunities for better than that were hard to track down. Those that she could find tended to be out of date, or fell apart shortly after trying to get her foot in the door. But hope was not lost for Sanniang.

One day in 7048 IC, she heard about a monastery that had been erected some seasons past, deep in the Specterwood. It was a couple decades old at this point, and Sanniang further dithered on whether to uproot what stability she had achieved in order to strike out again. When Sanniang did finally make the journey in 7055 IC, she feared that her worries had come to pass. The founding monk had passed the previous year, and the monks that had joined the monastery because of her were drifting away. However, there was still a small settlement nearby, which had been founded to support the monastery. Despite the monks leaving, the settlement showed no signs of breaking apart. So it was that Sanniang decided to stay and work there for some years, to think on her future and rebuild her travel fund.

A fresh start in a new town, able to make a difference from its early days, felt like the time to redefine herself. So she took on a new given name, Tian Shanxiang (田善祥, "humane and auspicious"). Although it took many years to shake the feeling of being an outsider, the townsfolk welcomed her warmly. Shanxiang saw many pass through town over the years, but remained a single subsistence farmer. Contenting herself to follow in her mother's footsteps, she didn't see much significance when overworked parents started asking her for the occasional day of babysitting their child. Shanxiang took to the task with surprising ease, and it strongly resonated with her. That she could overcome her bloody past by giving back. That she could balance the terrible memory of being an accomplice to child murder, but putting her all into caring for others' children.

It was around this point that Shanxiang found her faith. She had wanted, for some years now, to pray to Abadar. But his hard taboo against banditry scared her, as she feared she would be struck down for the blood on her hands. Finally ready to face her misdeeds head on, she begged Abadar for forgiveness. His response was spread out over the rest of the year, as more and more parents would ask her to take care of their children for a day, to take a burden off them. The message was clear: if Shanxiang wanted atonement, she could work for it.

And work, she did. Over time, her daycare services would be expanded and formalized, and she would receive a stipend from the governor to make it official. For decades, "Momma Xiang" taught the children of Willowshore their letters and numbers. She showed them around town, and guided them through gardening, cooking, and cleaning. They would do crafts, go fishing, or simply spend the day playing together. A sign would be eventually hoisted, proclaiming in messy child-scrawled strokes "Momma Xiang's", and a crude drawing of a dog's head and some flowers.

Shanxiang has amassed a large collection of artwork made by the children, letters written to her from them (or their parents), and especially drawings of the various pets that have been kept over the years. The current dog is a large pondering fluffy thing named Atou. As the class size slowly increased, the house would feel more cramped, the garden inadequate, and storage space very strained. So when Xiuhua offered Shanxiang to move in to her now-empty estate, in 7106 IC, Xiang could only bring herself to mutter flimsy polite refusals before accepting the new space.

"Momma Xiang's" now proudly hangs over the estate's gates. The gates themselves have been left open for so long that the plants would need to be cleared away to close them. The large bedrooms and dining room have been converted to bunkhouses, crafts rooms, and storage. There is a fish pond on the grounds, besides the vegetable patches and herb garden. The old posh furniture and decorations have been mostly traded away for more practical pieces. There is a rowboat in the yard, sitting by the short footpath down to the creek. A plot has been set aside for a small greenhouse, but the materials have yet to be gathered. The structure of the stable remains, now used for mushroom farming. The library remains intact, full of as many books as Xiuhua could hide away before the family's exodus, plus Shanxiang's own collection.
