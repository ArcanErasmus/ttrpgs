## Summoner (Arcane)
### Cantrips
#### Electric Arc
`[Cantrip]` `[Evocation]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, Verbal
- *Range*: 30 ft
- *Targets*: 1 or 2 creatures
- *Saving Throw*: Basic Reflex
An arc of lightning leaps from one target to another. You deal electricity damage equal to 1d4 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
- *Heightened (+1)*: The damage increases by 1d4.

#### Bullhorn
`[Cantrip]` `[Illusion]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, Verbal
- *Duration*: 10 minutes
You amplify your voice, loud enough for you to be heard easily at a great distance. For the duration, your voice can be heard loudly and clearly by all listeners within 500 feet, even if other ambient noise would otherwise block the sound. Despite the volume, this doesn't make your voice jarring or distracting. This doesn't increase the range or area of other auditory or linguistic effects, and physical barriers such as walls and doors still block or muffle your voice as normal.

Your loud voice makes it easier to Coerce others, and the acoustics assist in Performing at a large venue. You gain a +1 status bonus to checks to Coerce and auditory Performance checks to Perform at a large venue.

You can Dismiss the spell.
- *Heightened (5th)*: Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1,200 feet away.
- *Heightened (7th)*: Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1 mile away.

#### Gale Blast
`[Cantrip]` `[Evocation]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, Verbal
- *Saving Throw*: Fortitude
Wind flows from your outstretched hands and whirls around you in a 5-foot emanation. Each creature in the area takes bludgeoning damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (+4), with a Fortitude save.

Critical Success: The creature is unaffected.
Success: The creature takes half damage.
Failure: The creature takes full damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.
Critical Failure: The creature takes double damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
- *Heightened (+2)*: The damage increases by 1d6.

#### Protect Companion
`[Abjuration]` `[Cantrip]` `[>]`
- *Cast*: Verbal
- *Range*: 30 ft
- *Targets*: Your eidolon, or a creature with the minion trait under your control
- *Duration*: Until the start of your next turn
You extend your aura, as a magical shield that protects your eidolon or minion. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. You gain the following reaction; after using the reaction, the spell ends and you can't cast protect companion again for 10 minutes.

- *Heightened (+2)*: The reaction reduces the damage by another 10, and you lose 5 more Hit Points. If you want to lose fewer Hit Points, you can choose to lower the damage reduction and HP lost to what any lower-level version of the spell could do without lowering the spell's actual level.
##### Life Block [<]
- *Trigger*: The spell's target would take damage
Reduce the triggering damage by 10, but you lose 5 Hit Points. Even if this reduces the damage to 0, the target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, such as the poison on a viper's fangs Strike.

#### Prestidigitation
`[Cantrip]` `[Evocation]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, Verbal
- *Range*: 10 ft
- *Targets*: 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
- *Duration*: Sustained
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can choose one of four options.
Cook: Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
Lift Slowly: lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
Make: Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile - it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
Tidy: Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.

### Level 1
#### Alarm
`[Abjuration]`
- *Cast*: 10 mins (material, somatic, verbal)
- *Requirements*: 3gp silver bell focus
- *Range*: Touch
- *Area*: 20-ft burst
- *Duration*: 8 hrs
You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without your permission. When you cast alarm, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature enters the spell's area without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice of a mental alert (in which case the spell gains the mental trait) or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the auditory trait). Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell's DC or trigger the spell when moving into the area.
- *Heightened (3rd)*: You can specify criteria for which creatures sound the alarm spell - for instance, orcs or masked people.

#### Floating Disk
`[Conjuration]` `[Force]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, verbal
- *Duration*: 8 hours
A disk of magical force materializes adjacent to you. This disk is 2 feet in diameter and follows 5 feet behind you, floating just above the ground. It holds up to 5 Bulk of objects (though they must be able to fit and balance on its surface). Any objects atop the disk fall to the ground when the spell ends.

The spell ends if a creature tries to ride atop the disk, if the disk is overloaded, if anyone tries to lift or force the disk higher above the ground, or if you move more than 30 feet away from the disk.

#### Mage Armor
`[Abjuration]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, verbal
- *Duration*: Until the next time you make your daily preparations
You ward yourself with shimmering magical energy, gaining a +1 item bonus to AC and a maximum Dexterity modifier of +5. While wearing mage armor, you use your unarmored proficiency to calculate your AC.
- *Heightened (4th)*: You gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws.
- *Heightened (6th)*: The item bonus to AC increases to +2, and you gain a +1 item bonus to saving throws.
- *Heightened (8th)*: The item bonus to AC increases to +2, and you gain a +2 item bonus to saving throws.
- *Heightened (10th)*: The item bonus to AC increases to +3, and you gain a +3 item bonus to saving throws.

## Bard Archetype (Occult)
### Cantrips
#### Join Pasts
`[Uncommon]` `[Cantrip]` `[Divination]` `[Mental]` `[>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic
- *Range*: Touch
- *Targets*: 2 willing creatures
- *Duration*: 1 round
With touches to the targets’ foreheads, you bring them into mental communion. The targets can share thoughts and experiences, but not words. When one target attempts to Recall Knowledge, the other can Aid the first target’s skill check, using any Lore skill (even if that Lore wouldn’t normally apply) without having made any preparations to Aid.
- *Heightened (+1)*: You can touch one additional target to include them in the spell’s effects. Multiple targets can attempt checks to Aid the target who is attempting to Recall Knowledge.

#### Message
`[Auditory]` `[Cantrip]` `[Illusion]` `[Linguistic]` `[Mental]` `[>]`
- *Cast*: Verbal
- *Range*: 120 ft
- *Targets*: 1 creature
- *Duration*: See below
You mouth words quietly, but instead of coming out of your mouth, they're transferred directly to the ears of the target. While others can't hear your words any better than if you normally mouthed them, the target can hear your words as if they were standing next to you. The target can give a brief response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn if they wish, but they must be able to see you and be within range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered directly to your ear, just like the original message.
- *Heightened (3rd)*: The spell's range increases to 500 feet.

## Focus Spells
### Cantrips
#### Boost Eidolon
`[Uncommon]` `[Cantrip]` `[Evocation]` `[Summoner]` `[>]`
- *Cast*: Verbal
- *Range*: 100 ft
- *Targets*: Your eidolon
- *Duration*: 1 rd
You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and boost the power of your eidolon's attacks. Your eidolon gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with its unarmed attacks. If your eidolon's Strikes deal more than one weapon damage die, the status bonus increases to 2 per weapon damage die, to a maximum of +8 with four weapon damage dice.

### Focus 1
#### Evolution Surge
`[Uncommon]` `[Morph]` `[Summoner]` `[Transmutation]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, verbal
- *Range*: 100 ft
- *Targets*: Your eidolon
- *Duration*: 1 min
You flood your eidolon with power, creating a temporary evolution in your eidolon's capabilities. Choose one of the following effects:
    - Your eidolon gains low-light vision and darkvision.
    - Your eidolon gains scent as an imprecise sense up to 30 feet.
    - Your eidolon can breathe underwater and gains a swim Speed equal to its land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is less. Alternatively, if your eidolon is normally aquatic, it can breathe air and gains a land Speed equal to its swim Speed or 30 feet, whichever is less. Either way, it gains the amphibious trait.
    - Your eidolon gains a +20-foot status bonus to its Speed.
- *Heightened (3rd)*: Add the following options to the list of effects you can choose:
    - Your eidolon becomes Large, instead of its previous size. This increases your eidolon's reach to 10 feet but doesn't change any other statistics for your eidolon. Because of the special link you share, you can ride your eidolon without getting in each other's way. If another creature tries to ride your eidolon, both you and the riding creature each regain only 2 actions at the start of your turns each round, as normal.
    - Your eidolon gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed.
- *Heightened (5th)*: Add the options from the 3rd-level version and the following options to the list of effects you can choose:
    - Your eidolon becomes Huge, instead of its previous size. This has the same effects as the 3rd-level option to become Large, except your eidolon's reach increases to 15 feet.
    - Your eidolon gains a fly Speed equal to its Speed.
