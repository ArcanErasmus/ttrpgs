### Session 14?future - 2023-02-25
- Remember: THE FOREST IS ON FIRE, YO

### Session 13 - 2023-02-18
- Talking to cloaked lady with the burned wolf corpses
    - Wants to find the source of the altered animals, which aligns with our goals
    - We offer that we believe Hallod's mysterious contact is involved
- Continuing to the drop point, a specific tree stump
    - Lady offers that an irregular blight has been occuring, always starts at a grove of old growth trees and spreads from there
        - Likely means groundwater is contaminated, perhaps relates to a depth that roots reach
        - Perhaps an underground lab that leaks chemicals
- At the tree stump
    - Rasa sneaks into the grove, finds something concealed within it, a box/trunk
    - Box is empty except for a dried bit of "corpse blood" (an alchemical ingredient)
    - Re-examining the text on the note that was in Hallod's possession, we conclude he was hired by this outside contact to murder Bort
    - Emotional resonance on box: Infatuation, from Hallod
    - Lady's name is Noala, informs us she knows where den of unnatural wolves is
- Headed to the wolf den
    - Discuss my past with Sinta and Surya, share memories of the ritual and of my family/home
        - They conclude I might have been frozen in time
            - Great! My entire family is probably dead! Haha EVERYTHING IS FINE
            - "Maybe they also went forward in time" But they only did this for the children, and the others didn't have anything weird happen...
    - Everytime Surya says something religion-y, Noala tries to hide a reaction
    - Sinta lets slip her knowledge of occult ritual, very poorly tries to hide it
        - My prodding about Rasa's teacher causes Sinta's lies to rapidly crumble
        - Sinta's pitiful self-confidence falls apart entirely, Surya demands they "have a talk" later
- Approach the den
    - Plants get more sickly the closer we get, leaves then limbs then bark, eventually rot smell and leaking plant-pus
        - We get ambushed by vine-bushes
        - The fight is ROUGH, I teeter on the verge of death about a dozen times
        - Oh no, oh no, ANOTHER FOREST FIRE STARTS

    - Sinta sneakily shares memory of the text on the note Hallod had (meaningless to me, except for the feeling of shock and disgust from Sinta), I share daydreaming about eating Hallod (comes with feeling of anger and anxiety)

    - There was a terrifying fire-breathing boar
    - It hurt us but we put it to sleep and hid from it

## Backstory
- From a small desert hunting-gathering clan in the Age of Magic
    - Clan was visited by a frenzied mystic named Ao Shetep, performed rituals to "protect our souls" in a sanctum
    - Soul-uploaded into some sort of warded charm by the ritual
    - Charm survived, eventually was recovered in the modern day by a plucky adventuring wizard
    - Wizard tried to make a familiar, used my charm in the attempt, but the process was overtaken by the charm's ancient magics, and instead consumed the charm and re-embodied me. The confused wizard let me go in order to not raise ethical concerns and retried their familiar binding later
