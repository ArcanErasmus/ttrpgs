### Session 8 - 2022-11-19
- North side of town, an owlbear has shown up
    - Townsfolk and Rasa loose a volley
    - After a quick melee, Surya carves it apart
    - However, a fire was started (and I heard Granz cast Wildfire)
    - Also, the owlbear was previously treated for burns
- A fire was started (AGAIN!)
    - Quick action and a dedicated bucket train put the fire out
    - Neither Hallod or Phinick showed up...
    - Granz straight up admits to starting the fire!
        - AND THE FIRE IN THE FOREST!!!!!
    - Owlbear corpse was skinned and butchered, contained some stuff
- The group argues WAY TOO MUCH before making any useful progress
    - Not even about how to get to Phinick/Hallod/Trin
- Rasa and I head to Trin's house
    - There was a terrifying fire-breathing boar
    - It hurt us but we put it to sleep and hid from it
    - Trin thinks Phinick either ran out of town or is staying in an abandoned house
    - If Phinick did run, he would have to come back soon, he can't hunt
    - Trin confused why people in town don't like folk from north of The Teeth, something about the witches there, Phinick is from there

### Session 7 - 2022-11-12
- Sherif Rolth interrogates other members of the caravan
    - His suspicions and questions lean towards "Who would want to inherit Bort's business/wealth?"

    - He was generally well-loved
    - Tamli Grent gave an especially impassioned speech about how Bort was a close friend

    - Rasa searches the tavern's taproom, finds nothing of note
    - Sinta uses prestidigitation to copy the poison's flavor onto an object, to test animals' recognition of the scent (gets help from Granz)
    - Granz & Sinta get a tipoff about especially dangerous hostile creatures having moved into a foraging spot nearby
    - Surya searches the paperwork left behind by Bort, chaperoned by Tamli, and requests assistance from the well-read Sinta
- Midmorning downtime
    - Rasa surveyed nearby wildlife, discovered an owlbear, a boar showing unnaturally agitated behavior, a non-native spider that is also active outside of seasonal habits
    - I scan the tavern's kitchen for psychometric resonance
        - On Bort's bowl, detect fear
        - Focusing on it reveals the face of the goblin who was working at the bar

    - Share memory with Rasa
        - Receive memory of Rasa being pressured by his master to kill a magical beast, and the associated fear
        - Rasa implies that the bar employee Goblin might have been pressured into it
    - Looking for The Goblin
        - Delma Fulst, bartender at and possible owner of The Feedmill, gives the name Phinick
        - Delma doesn't believe he would be possibly connected
        - Phinick doesn't have a permanent residence, but often stays around the barn
        - Other employee, Trin, knows Phinick more
        - Phinick was specifically scared of Hallod, who Delma says is known as the town bully
        - Hallod has apparently claimed one of the abandoned houses on the north side of town (not sure which)
        - Delma's father, Mayor Targen Fulst, is very old and somewhat senile, likely not helpful
    - Searching the stables with Rasa
        - Find an empty green glass vial, has same fear, has same smell as Bort's bowl
        - Has the same psychic flavor of fear attached
    - Reconveining with the party
        - Shares investigatory progress with Surya, receives brief memory-blip of child-Sinta getting piggyback ride
- Shouts of alarm from the north side of town
    - The befriended owlbear has a sheep it has killed
    - Granz tries to peacefully shoo the owlbear, accidentally signals the townsfolk to fire their aimed bows/crossbows
