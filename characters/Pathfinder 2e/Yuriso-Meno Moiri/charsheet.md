### Skill & General Feats
#### Assurance (Survival) (1st)
`[Fortune]` `[General]` `[Skill]`
Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks. Choose a skill youâ€™re trained in. You can forgo rolling a skill check for that skill to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).

#### Read Psychometric Resonance (2nd)
`[Uncommon]` `[Concentrate]` `[Divination]` `[Emotion]` `[Exploration]` `[General]` `[Mental]` `[Occult]` `[Skill]`
With a touch, you can read the psychic impressions left on objects by their previous owners. This exploration activity functions similarly to Detect Magic in that you move at half your travel speed or slower while looking for psychometric resonance. You must brush your bare hands over any objects you pass while you do this. This detects objects with significant emotional resonance attached to them, such as the joy from a child's beloved teddy bear, the sorrow from a widower's wedding ring, or the fear from a victim's murder weapon. If you're looking for a particular type of emotional resonance, you can choose to ignore other emotions. If you find an item with that resonance, you can explore that resonance with the following action.

Psychometric Assessment (concentrate, divination, emotion, exploration, mental, occult) Requirements Your bare hands are touching an object in which you detected psychometric resonance; Effect You spend 1 minute concentrating on the object to get a vision of the face of the person who imbued the item with such emotion in the first place. If the associated emotion is painfully negative, you might take 1d6 psychic damage, as determined by the GM.

## Ancestry & Background
### Ancestry - Kobold
`[Uncommon]` `[Humanoid]`
- Size: Small
- Senses: Darkvision
- Speed: 25 ft

#### Draconic Exemplar
- Draconic Exemplar: Brass
- Scale color: Brass (with emerald patches/streaks)
- Details: Line, Fire, Reflex

### Ancestry Feats
#### Kobold Breath (1st)
`[Arcane]` `[Evocation]` `[Kobold]` `[>>]`
- Type: Fire, Line, Reflex
You channel your draconic exemplar's power into a gout of energy that manifests as a 30-foot line or a 15-foot cone, dealing 1d4 damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4. The shape of the breath, the damage type, and the saving throw match those of your draconic exemplar (see Table 1-1). This ability has the trait associated with the type of damage it deals.

### Background - Nomad (Jungle)
Traveling far and wide, you picked up basic tactics for surviving on the road and in unknown lands, getting by with few supplies and even fewer comforts. As an adventurer, you travel still, often into even more dangerous places. Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost. You're trained in the Survival skill and Jungle Lore. You gain the Assurance skill feat with Survival.

## Class - Summoner
### Eidolon
You have a connection with a powerful and usually otherworldly entity called an eidolon, and you can use your life force as a conduit to manifest this ephemeral entity into the mortal world. Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting below). Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features. Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before. You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.

#### Manifest Eidolon
`[Arcane]` `[Concentrate]` `[Conjuration]` `[Manipulate]` `[Summoner]` `[Teleportation]` `[>>>]`
Your eidolon appears in an open space adjacent to you, and can then take a single action. If your eidolon was already manifested, you unmanifest it instead.

The conduit that allows your eidolon to manifest is also a tether between you. Your eidolon must remain within 100 feet of you at all times and can't willingly go beyond that limit. If forced beyond this distance, or if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, your eidolon's physical form dissolves: your eidolon unmanifests, and you need to use Manifest Eidolon to manifest it again.

--

Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.

#### Act Together
`[Summoner]` `[Tandem]` `[> - >>>]`
- Frequency: 1/rd
You and your eidolon act as one. Either you or your eidolon takes an action or activity using the same number of actions as Act Together, and the other takes a single action. For example, if you spent 2 actions to Act Together, you could cast burning hands (2 actions) and your eidolon could Strike (1 action), or your eidolon could use its Breath Weapon (2 actions) and you could Stride (1 action).

This lets you each use separate exploration activities like Avoid Notice as you travel.

--

Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.

#### Share Senses
`[Arcane]` `[Concentrate]` `[Divination]` `[Scrying]` `[Summoner]` `[>]`
- Requirements: Your eidolon is manifested.
You project your senses into your eidolon, allowing you to perceive through it. When you do, you lose all sensory information from your own body, but can sense through your eidolon's body for up to 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect.

Special: Your eidolon can also use this ability. When it does, it projects its senses into your body.

--

Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.

#### Gear And Your Eidolon
Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.

Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.

Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.

Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.

#### Lost And Altered Actions
If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were slowed 1, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon slowed 2, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became immobilized or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.

You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the confused or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.

### Summoner Spellcasting
Your link to your eidolon grants you limited magic connected to your eidolon's nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eidolon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need a material component pouch.

Each day, you can cast one 1st-level spell and five cantrips. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.

As you increase in level as a summoner, the magical link with your eidolon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table 2â€“4: Summoner Spells per Day. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eidolon, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the summoner class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Roll.

#### Heightening Spells
When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.

#### Cantrips
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a summoner. For example, as a 1st-level summoner, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level summoner, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

### Spell Repertoire
The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eidolon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2â€“4: Summoner Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire. At 4th level you gain your second and your spell repertoire reaches its maximum size of five spells.

At 5th level, in addition to adding two 3rd-level spells to your repertoire, you lose your lowest level of spell slots. Any time you lose a level of spell slots, you lose two spells in your repertoire as well. These can come from spells you already know or out of the number of new spells you're learning. On levels in which you don't change your spell slots, you can swap out multiple spells, as described below.

#### Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it's a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.

At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don't end up with slots you can't use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-level spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd level.

### Link Spells
Your connection to your eidolon allows you to cast link spells, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eidolon. Link spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to specifically connect with your eidolon, such as by having a heart-to-heart conversation, playing together, or meditating in unison on the nature of your bond.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells appear here.

You learn the evolution surge link spell, which allows you to grant your eidolon one of several useful benefits.

#### Link Cantrips
Link cantrips are special link spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like. Link cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from your tradition's spell list. Generally, only feats can give you more link cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out link cantrips gained from summoner feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.

You learn the boost eidolon link cantrip, which briefly improves your eidolon's capabilities, allowing it to attack with greater power.

### Class & Archetype Feats
#### Energy Heart (1st)
`[Evolution]` `[Summoner]`
- Type: Cold
Your eidolon's heart beats with energy. Choose an energy damage type other than force. One of its unarmed attacks changes its damage type to the chosen type, and it gains resistance to that type equal to half your level (minimum 1).

#### Bard Dedication (2nd)
`[Archetype]` `[Dedication]` `[Multiclass]`
- Muse: Maestro
You cast spells like a bard and gain the Cast a Spell activity. You gain a spell repertoire with two common cantrips from the occult spell list, or any other cantrips you learn or discover. Youâ€™re trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs for occult spells. Your key spellcasting ability for bard archetype spells is Charisma, and they are occult bard spells. You become trained in Occultism and Performance; for each of these skills in which you were already trained, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.

Choose a muse as you would if you were a bard. You have that muse for all purposes, allowing you to take that museâ€™s feats, but you donâ€™t gain any of the other abilities it grants.

Special: You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the bard archetype. 

## Spells
### Summoner (Arcane)
#### Electric Arc
`[Cantrip]` `[Evocation]` `[>>]`
- Cast: Somatic, Verbal

#### Bullhorn
`[Cantrip]` `[Illusion]` `[>>]`

You amplify your voice, loud enough for you to be heard easily at a great distance. For the duration, your voice can be heard loudly and clearly by all listeners within 500 feet, even if other ambient noise would otherwise block the sound. Despite the volume, this doesn't make your voice jarring or distracting. This doesn't increase the range or area of other auditory or linguistic effects, and physical barriers such as walls and doors still block or muffle your voice as normal.

Your loud voice makes it easier to Coerce others, and the acoustics assist in Performing at a large venue. You gain a +1 status bonus to checks to Coerce and auditory Performance checks to Perform at a large venue.

You can Dismiss the spell.
- Heightened (5th) Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1,200 feet away.
- Heightened (7th) Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1 mile away.

- Heightened (+2) The reaction reduces the damage by another 10, and you lose 5 more Hit Points. If you want to lose fewer Hit Points, you can choose to lower the damage reduction and HP lost to what any lower-level version of the spell could do without lowering the spell's actual level.
##### Life Block [<]
- Trigger: The spell's target would take damage
Reduce the triggering damage by 10, but you lose 5 Hit Points. Even if this reduces the damage to 0, the target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, such as the poison on a viper's fangs Strike.

#### Prestidigitation
`[Cantrip]` `[Evocation]` `[>>]`
- Cast: Somatic, Verbal
- Range: 10 ft
- Targets: 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
