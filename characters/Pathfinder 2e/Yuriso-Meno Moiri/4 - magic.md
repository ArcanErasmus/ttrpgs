## Repertoir - Summoner (Arcane)
### Cantrips
#### Electric Arc
`[Cantrip]` `[Concentrate]` `[Electricity]` `[Manipulate]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: 30 ft
- *Targets*: 1 or 2 creatures
- *Saving Throw*: Basic Reflex
An arc of lightning leaps from one target to another. Each target takes 4d4 electricity damage with a basic Reflex save.
- *Heightened (+1)*: The damage increases by 1d4.
- (This spell has been auto-heightened from Spell Level 1 (+2))

#### Bullhorn
`[Auditory]` `[Cantrip]` `[Concentrate]` `[Illusion]` `[Manipulate]` `[>>]`
- *Duration*: 10 minutes
You amplify your voice, loud enough for you to be heard easily at a great distance. For the duration, your voice can be heard loudly and clearly by all listeners within 500 feet, even if other ambient noise would otherwise block the sound. Despite the volume, this doesn't make your voice jarring or distracting. This doesn't increase the range or area of other auditory or linguistic effects, and physical barriers such as walls and doors still block or muffle your voice as normal.

Your loud voice makes it easier to Coerce others, and the acoustics assist in Performing at a large venue. You gain a +1 status bonus to checks to Coerce and auditory Performance checks to Perform at a large venue.

You can Dismiss the spell.
- *Heightened (5th)*: Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1,200 feet away.
- *Heightened (7th)*: Your voice can be heard clearly up to 1 mile away.

#### Gouging Claw
`[Attack]` `[Concentrate]` `[Manipulate]` `[Morph]` `[Cantrip]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: Touch
- *Targets*: 1 creature
- *Defense*: AC
You temporarily morph your limb into a clawed appendage. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC. If you hit, you deal your choice of 2d6 slashing damage or 4d6 piercing damage, plus 4 persistent bleed damage. On a critical success, you deal double damage and double bleed damage.
- *Heightened (+1)*: The damage increases by 1d6 and the persistent bleed damage increases by 1.
- (This spell has been auto-heightened from Spell Level 1 (+2))

#### Protect Companion
`[Abjuration]` `[Cantrip]` `[>]`
- *Range*: 30 ft
- *Targets*: Your eidolon, or a creature with the minion trait under your control
- *Duration*: Until the start of your next turn
You extend your aura, as a magical shield that protects your eidolon or minion. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. You gain the following reaction; after using the reaction, the spell ends and you can't cast protect companion again for 10 minutes.

- *Heightened (+2)*: The reaction reduces the damage by another 10, and you lose 5 more Hit Points. If you want to lose fewer Hit Points, you can choose to lower the damage reduction and HP lost to what any lower-level version of the spell could do without lowering the spell's actual level.
- (This spell has been auto-heightened from Spell Level 1 (+2))
##### Life Block [<]
- *Trigger*: The spell's target would take damage
Reduce the triggering damage by 20, but you lose 10 Hit Points. Even if this reduces the damage to 0, the target still takes any effects that would come with the damage, such as the poison on a viper's fangs Strike.

#### Prestidigitation
`[Cantrip]` `[Concentrate]` `[Manipulate]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: 10 ft
- *Targets*: 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
- *Duration*: Sustained
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can choose one of four options.
    - Cook: Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
    - Lift Slowly: lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
    - Make: Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile - it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
    - Tidy: Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.
Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the spell. 

### Level 1
#### Shattering Gem
`[Abjuration]` `[Earth]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: Touch
- *Targets*: 1 creature
- *Duration*: 1 minute
A large gem floats around the target in an erratic pattern. The gem has 5 Hit Points. Each time a creature Strikes the target, the target attempts a DC 11 flat check. On a success, the gem blocks the attack, so the attack first damages the gem and then applies any remaining damage to the target. If the gem is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it shatters, immediately dealing 1d8 slashing damage (basic Reflex save) to the creature that destroyed it, as long as that creature is within 10 feet of the target.
- *Heightened (+1)* The gem has 5 additional HP, and the damage dealt by its detonation increases by 1d8.

### Level 2
#### Blazing Bolt
`[Attack]` `[Concentrate]` `[Fire]` `[Manipulate]` `[> - >>>]`
- *Range*: 60ft
- *Defense*: AC
- *Targets*: 1 or more creatures
You fire a ray of heat and flame. Make a spell attack roll against a single creature. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and on a critical hit, the target takes double damage.

For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, you can fire an additional ray at a different target, to a maximum of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions.

These attacks each increase your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for blazing bolt. If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire damage on a hit, and it still deals double damage on a critical hit.
- *Heightened (+1)* The damage to each target increases by 1d6 for the 1-action version, or by 2d6 for the 2- and 3-action versions.

#### Floating Flame
`[Concentrate]` `[Fire]` `[Manipulate]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: 30 feet
- *Area*: 1 5-foot square
- *Defense*: Reflex
- *Duration*: sustained up to 1 minute
You create a fire that burns without fuel and moves to your commands. The flame deals 3d6 fire damage to each creature in the square in which it appears, with a basic Reflex save. When you Sustain this spell, you can levitate the flame up to 10 feet. It then deals damage to each creature whose space it shared at any point during its flight. This uses the same damage and save, and you roll the damage once each time you Sustain. A given creature can take damage from floating flame only once per round.
- *Heightened (+1)* The damage increases by 1d6.

### Level 3
#### Cave Fangs
`[Concentrate]` `[Earth]` `[Manipulate]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: 60 ft
- *Area*: 20-ft burst
- *Saving Throw*: Basic Reflex
- *Duration*: 1 minute
Sharp flowstone formations protrude from the ground and ceiling, dealing 6d6 piercing damage to creatures in the area with a basic Reflex save. Densely packed with protrusions, the area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. The protrusions turn to dust when the spell ends. You can Dismiss the spell.
- *Heightened (+1)*: The damage increases by 2d6.

#### Haste
`[Concentrate]` `[Manipulate]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: 30 ft
- *Targets*: 1 creature
- *Duration*: 1 minute
Magic empowers the target to act faster. It gains the quickened condition and can use the extra action each round for only Strike and Stride actions.
- *Heightened (7th)*: You can target up to 6 creatures.

## Repertoir - Archetype Bard (Occult)
### Cantrips
#### Join Pasts
`[Uncommon]` `[Cantrip]` `[Divination]` `[Mental]` `[>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic
- *Range*: Touch
- *Targets*: 4 willing creatures, or 3 and yourself
- *Duration*: 1 round
With touches to the targets’ foreheads, you bring them into mental communion. The targets can share thoughts and experiences, but not words. When one target attempts to Recall Knowledge, the other can Aid the first target’s skill check, using any Lore skill (even if that Lore wouldn’t normally apply) without having made any preparations to Aid.
- *Heightened (+1)*: You can touch one additional target to include them in the spell’s effects. Multiple targets can attempt checks to Aid the target who is attempting to Recall Knowledge.
- (This spell has been auto-heightened from Spell Level 1 (+2))

#### Message
`[Auditory]` `[Cantrip]` `[Illusion]` `[Linguistic]` `[Mental]` `[>]`
- *Cast*: Verbal
- *Range*: 500 ft
- *Targets*: 1 creature
- *Duration*: See below
You mouth words quietly, but instead of coming out of your mouth, they're transferred directly to the ears of the target. While others can't hear your words any better than if you normally mouthed them, the target can hear your words as if they were standing next to you. The target can give a brief response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn if they wish, but they must be able to see you and be within range to do so. If they respond, their response is delivered directly to your ear, just like the original message.
- *Heightened (3rd)*: The spell's range increases to 500 feet.
- (This spell has been auto-heightened from Spell Level 1 (+2))

### Level 1
#### Friendfetch
`[Uncommon]` `[Evocation]` `[Force]` `[Legacy]` `[>>]`
- *Range*: 30 ft
- *Targets*: 1 or 2 willing creatures
You shoot out ephemeral, telekinetic strands that drag each target directly toward you, stopping in the closest unoccupied space to you in this path. This is forced movement.

### Level 2
#### Mimic Undead
`[Necromancy]` `[Legacy]` `[>>]`
- *Requirements*: You are a living creature
- *Duration*: 10 minutes
You take death and wrap it about you like a cloak—your colors wash out and your skin grows cold to the touch. Your heartbeat, breathing, and similar life functions become very difficult to detect. Senses such as lifesense detect you as undead unless a creature succeeds at a Perception check against the spell's DC, and on a failed check, they don't detect you at all if they only sense living creatures. Detection spells that specifically sense living creatures must succeed at a counteract check against mimic undead to detect you. You gain a +4 status bonus to Impersonate an undead but physically intact version of yourself and can add your level as your proficiency bonus even if you're untrained. You don't gain these benefits to Impersonate any other sort of undead. Mindless undead usually don't have a reason to even attempt the Perception check to notice your Impersonation unless you interact with them in some way.

## Focus Spells
### Cantrips
#### Boost Eidolon
`[Uncommon]` `[Cantrip]` `[Evocation]` `[Summoner]` `[>]`
- *Cast*: Verbal
- *Range*: 100 ft
- *Targets*: Your eidolon
- *Duration*: 1 rd
You focus deeply on the link between you and your eidolon and boost the power of your eidolon's attacks. Your eidolon gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls with its unarmed attacks. If your eidolon's Strikes deal more than one weapon damage die, the status bonus increases to 2 per weapon damage die, to a maximum of +8 with four weapon damage dice.

### Focus 1
#### Evolution Surge
`[Uncommon]` `[Morph]` `[Summoner]` `[Transmutation]` `[>>]`
- *Cast*: Somatic, verbal
- *Range*: 100 ft
- *Targets*: Your eidolon
- *Duration*: 1 min
You flood your eidolon with power, creating a temporary evolution in your eidolon's capabilities. Choose one of the following effects:
    - Your eidolon gains low-light vision and darkvision.
    - Your eidolon gains scent as an imprecise sense up to 30 feet.
    - Your eidolon can breathe underwater and gains a swim Speed equal to its land Speed or 30 feet, whichever is less. Alternatively, if your eidolon is normally aquatic, it can breathe air and gains a land Speed equal to its swim Speed or 30 feet, whichever is less. Either way, it gains the amphibious trait.
    - Your eidolon gains a +20-foot status bonus to its Speed.
    - *(3rd)* Your eidolon becomes Large, instead of its previous size. This increases your eidolon's reach to 10 feet but doesn't change any other statistics for your eidolon. Because of the special link you share, you can ride your eidolon without getting in each other's way. If another creature tries to ride your eidolon, both you and the riding creature each regain only 2 actions at the start of your turns each round, as normal.
    - *(3rd)* Your eidolon gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed.
- *Heightened (3rd)*: (Adds options to list)
- *Heightened (5th)*: Add the options from the 3rd-level version and the following options to the list of effects you can choose:
    - Your eidolon becomes Huge, instead of its previous size. This has the same effects as the 3rd-level option to become Large, except your eidolon's reach increases to 15 feet.
    - Your eidolon gains a fly Speed equal to its Speed.
- (This spell has been auto-heightened from Spell Level 1 (+2))
