    - Wants to find the source of the altered animals, which aligns with our goals
    - We offer that we believe Hallod's mysterious contact is involved
- Continuing to the drop point, a specific tree stump
    - Lady offers that an irregular blight has been occuring, always starts at a grove of old growth trees and spreads from there
        - Likely means groundwater is contaminated, perhaps relates to a depth that roots reach
        - Perhaps an underground lab that leaks chemicals
- At the tree stump
    - Rasa sneaks into the grove, finds something concealed within it, a box/trunk
    - Box is empty except for a dried bit of "corpse blood" (an alchemical ingredient)

            - Great! My entire family is probably dead! Haha EVERYTHING IS FINE
            - "Maybe they also went forward in time" But they only did this for the children, and the others didn't have anything weird happen...
    - Everytime Surya says something religion-y, Noala tries to hide a reaction
    - Sinta lets slip her knowledge of occult ritual, very poorly tries to hide it
        - My prodding about Rasa's teacher causes Sinta's lies to rapidly crumble
        - Sinta's pitiful self-confidence falls apart entirely, Surya demands they "have a talk" later

    - Annotated ritual instruction
    - Ritual was supposed to re-incarnate (re-body?) Sakari into a healthy version of her own body
    - Ritual altered to make it appear to be a ritual that Sinta could cast
    - Notable absence where ritual would kill the caster, presumably got someone else to cast or found a way around???
- Iona leaves for New Belameer, helping shopkeep pack up and journeying with them

## Backstory
- From a small desert hunting-gathering clan in the Age of Magic
    - Clan was visited by a frenzied mystic named Ao Shetep, performed rituals to "protect our souls" in a sanctum
    - Soul-uploaded into some sort of warded charm by the ritual
    - Charm survived, eventually was recovered in the modern day by a plucky adventuring wizard
    - Wizard tried to make a familiar, used my charm in the attempt, but the process was overtaken by the charm's ancient magics, and instead consumed the charm and re-embodied me. The confused wizard let me go in order to not raise ethical concerns and retried their familiar binding later
