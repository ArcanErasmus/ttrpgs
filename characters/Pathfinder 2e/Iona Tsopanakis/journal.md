## Backstory
- TODO

- wake up in a body of bone and lead and crystals
    - in the middle of some magic circle
    - in a room full of writings and trinkets
    - in front of me is a pile of robes
    - i feel self-conscious, so i put on the robes
    - goal: determine where i am, who i am, what i am, why i am
    - i find records of stories about old magic, and learn i can read more than one language listed
    - i find signs that the place was inhabited, and recently so, but only by one being
    - i find books on summoning, on animating, on raising the dead
    - i find a mirror, and see the clearly constructed nature of my body
    - conclusion: i am the result of a ritual, and this body is a vessel for some sort of animating spirit (me)
    - conclusion: this is the abode of whoever performed the ritual
    - i realize that i can recognize objects in my surroundings, languages, and even my own self-consciousness about my appearance
    - conclusion: i am not an animated construct, only operating with imparted knowledge or by command
    - i realize that i can read the newer tomes, and the notes accompanying older ones, and am not confused by the layout of the abode
    - conclusion: i am not someone who lived long ago, or from a far-away culture
    - i realize the robes in front of me when i awoke were crumpled as if haphazardly dropped
    - i realize everything else was meticulously laid out
    - i realize that the ritual books talk of a sacrifice
    - i realize there was nobody around when i arrived
    - i realize the candles had barely burned, so it was a short time between casting and my awakening
    - conclusion: there was not likely a sacrifice provided for the ritual
    - conclusion: the caster sacrificed themselves for the ritual
    - i realize i have some recognition of the ritual circle that i woke up in
    - i read the tomes i found most at hand, determined the ritual was flawed
    - conclusion: i was someone who had experience working with these types of rituals
    - i realize there were notes explaining every single other part of the ritual
    - i realize there were no notes pertaining to deliberate modification of the ritual
    - conclusion: the caster did not intend to be the sacrifice
    - conclusion: the ritual was performed under heavy stresses, sleep deprivation, or otherwise in unoptimal conditions
    - i realize i felt stress upon waking, that faded without being reinforced by physiological effects that normally accompany it
    - conclusion... was i the caster?
    - goal: determine why the ritual was being pursued, and so fervently
    - goal: figure out how i fit into society
- leave the abode and venture into town
    - "into town" turned out to be quite a distance away
    - i start hearing voices, not visible
    - i realize they are coming from my body parts
