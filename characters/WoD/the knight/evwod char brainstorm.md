Character concept, round 2
- inspirations: Lung, Raine, Skitter, Grue
- BETTER inspirations: Coil, Luliana
- former member of ???-hunters
    - middling-seniority, no leadership position
        - the group was very anonymous, isolated information
        - i had no contacts outside of two of my superiors, but i also had info to contact Smithy
    - a bad hunt led to the near-obliteration of our group, remainders fled/disbanded
        - this was cause for my exaltation, after the adrenaline faded and the rage and helplessness settled in
    - none of my superiors remained, nobody i had any way to reconnect with, so i went to Smithy
        - on fear of being hunted by that which we failed to kill, i asked about other groups she may have had contact with
        - (possibly worked a job or two with Smithy) and somehow The Portal comes up (or just appears?)
        - looking for an escape, i take the opportunity

- infernal exalt
- Conqueror/Corrupter/Manipulator?
- crown of eyes/night

- angelic appearance?

- aspirationally: devil-tyrant form, the biggest +dex or the even bonuses one
- 7 of likely these aspects:
    * camouflage
    * extra limbs
    * flight
    * keen (sight)
    * stealthy
    * swift stride
    * tentacles
- or possibly these:
    - aquatic
    - demon armor
    - demon weapons
    - energy projection
    - gills
    - hardened devil body
    - nightvision
    - transcendent anathema

dragonslayers inspiration
- you are part of a small cell facing off against supernatural threats
    - (you are actually working for the technocracy, but do not know this)
- you were supposed to hunt down this alchemical
- and thus you "entered a tinker's lair"
- said supernatural ambushes/traps your group, and carves through it
- you run, very fast, and are one of the few who did so successfully
- you have no means of contacting the group that won't be found out by said supernatural

- result: healthy respect/fear/hatred for supernaturals

- crown of eyes: a cloud of golden smoke that pours off my head, filled with eyes
