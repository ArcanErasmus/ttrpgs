# Character Planning
## Abstract Ideas
- Bakuda, Kenzie
- Zuko ("regain my honor"), Detective Gumshoe, sitcom character (thinks she's edgier than she is)
- Not as manic, but real "life is not enough" energy
- PI because
    - Good at it? Hacking, physical infiltration, social engineering, recon, connecting information
    - Desire for it? Living through others, juicy secrets, tearing apart conspiracies, solving mysteries
- Other twists
    - Chronic illness? Fears for short lifespan, desire to experience through targets?
    - Familial expectation? Desire for wealth, or fame, or respectability?
    - keep thinking on this
- Hobbies?
- Social life?

## Evolving Concept
- Kith
    - Clurichaun?
        - Play into the rough and tumble protagonist angle. Always biting off a little more than she can chew, coming out with as many new friends as enemies
    - Selkies?
        - Could lean into the coastal angle, need to think about the deep passion and mortal fixation. Makes being a PI seem more like a regular job.
    - Sidhe (Autumn)?
        - Power-building matters, but getting hands dirty is not stigmatized. Strict upgrade over Arcadian, solid candidate.
    - Trolls?
        - Oaths are really fun, need to figure out how to tie in PI angle
- Court
    - Seelie? Traditionalist characters are against the grain for me, might fit in (especially one who is a failure at what they want)
- Legacy
    - 
- Seeming
    - Wilder. +1 Glamour OR WP, trigger from denying an opportunity for adventure (unless already on an adventure)
        - Gripes and grumbles about the call to action, but always accepts. Think Han Solo, when Chewie gives him a Look
    - What was I like as a Childling?
    - Why am I not yet a Grump?
- House

## Why did I hire you, other member?
- Keane Ã‰mile (the lunar single mom to Francis)
    - The Verbena is the local Mage Chantry, therefore the defining figure in local Mage politics
    - *To be on good terms, for resources and info, I need to provide a job for her character*
    - Verbena have a very good relationship with Changelings, so consider representing this with some dots of Allies/Contact or the like
- The angry sorceress (the infernal)
    - Complication: Influential member of the Verbena sees the sorceress as an ontological evil, does not want her around
    - Option: The girlfriend who is a bad idea (could also just be "the coworker who is a bad idea")
    - *Option: She's taking care of the symptoms of some malady, so I'm on the hook for her. Might be my roommate because she keeps pushing and I can't say no*
    - Why has she chosen me? Insulation from the Verbena, place to sleep/a house servant
- Amira (the toreador)
- Ash (the abyssal)

## Backgrounds/merits/flaws
- Supernatural Status
- Allies/Contact (Verbena)
- Some chronic suffering or curse that is being suppressed by the sorceress
- Resources (not a lot)
- Freehold at one dot?
    - Works well esp for Sidhe
- Mentor?
    - in what?
- Remembrance?
