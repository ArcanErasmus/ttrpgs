# Character Planning
## Abstract Ideas
- Bakuda, Kenzie
- Zuko ("regain my honor"), Detective Gumshoe, sitcom character (thinks she's edgier than she is)
- Not as manic, but real "life is not enough" energy
- PI because
    - Good at it? Hacking, physical infiltration, social engineering, recon, connecting information
    - Desire for it? Living through others, juicy secrets, tearing apart conspiracies, solving mysteries
- Other twists
    - Chronic illness? Fears for short lifespan, desire to experience through targets?
    - Familial expectation? Desire for wealth, or fame, or respectability?
    - keep thinking on this
- Hobbies?
- Social life?

## Evolving Concept
- Kith
    - Clurichaun?
        - Play into the rough and tumble protagonist angle. Always biting off a little more than she can chew, coming out with as many new friends as enemies
    - Selkies?
        - Could lean into the coastal angle, need to think about the deep passion and mortal fixation. Makes being a PI seem more like a regular job.
    - Sidhe (Autumn)?
        - Power-building matters, but getting hands dirty is not stigmatized. Strict upgrade over Arcadian, solid candidate.
    - Trolls?
        - Oaths are really fun, need to figure out how to tie in PI angle
- Court
    - Seelie? Traditionalist characters are against the grain for me, might fit in (especially one who is a failure at what they want)
    - Unseelie? Easier to stomach uncaring attitudes towards mortals
- Legacy
    - 
- Seeming
    - Wilder. +1 Glamour OR WP, trigger from denying an opportunity for adventure (unless already on an adventure)
        - Gripes and grumbles about the call to action, but always accepts. Think Han Solo, when Chewie gives him a Look
    - What was I like as a Childling?
    - Why am I not yet a Grump?
- House
    - Scathach
    - Crossed the Sabbat in a way that endangered a treaty they had with House Gwydion, forced to flee the Kingdom of the Feathered Serpent (Mexico)
        - Suggestion: Saved a commoner that was being preyed upon by a politically important Sabbat member
    - TODO: Find a mentor or other figure who inducted you into House Scathach

## Why did I hire you, other member?
- Keane Ã‰mile (the lunar single mom to Francis)
    - The Verbena is the local Mage Chantry, therefore the defining figure in local Mage politics
    - *To be on good terms, for resources and info, I need to provide a job for her character*
    - Verbena have a very good relationship with Changelings, so consider representing this with some dots of Allies/Contact or the like
- The angry sorceress (the infernal)
    - Complication: Influential member of the Verbena sees the sorceress as an ontological evil, does not want her around
    - Option: The girlfriend who is a bad idea (could also just be "the coworker who is a bad idea")
    - *Option: She's taking care of the symptoms of some malady, so I'm on the hook for her. Might be my roommate because she keeps pushing and I can't say no*
    - Why has she chosen me? Insulation from the Verbena, place to sleep/a house servant
- Amira (the toreador)
- Ash (the abyssal)

## Backgrounds/merits/flaws
- Supernatural Status
- Allies/Contact (Verbena)
- Some chronic suffering or curse that is being suppressed by the sorceress
- Resources (not a lot)
- Freehold at one dot?
    - Works well esp for Sidhe
- Mentor?
    - in what?
- Remembrance?

# Character Creation
## Step One: Concept
- A late-awakened clurichaun commoner who yearned for the connections and stability of a noble house. After making enemies of the Sabbat in the Kingdom of the Feathered Serpent, she was cursed and exiled to the USA alone, keeping her mortal family in the dark. Having since been sworn in to House Scathach, she works to build her own mixed network, while managing her enemies and her magical malady.
- Kith: Clurichaun
- Court: Seelie
- Legacy:
    - S: Paladin - Regain WP when overcome a truly challenging obstacle; Never refuse a fair challenge
