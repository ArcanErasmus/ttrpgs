# Alternate Charsheet Details
## Cover - Cartographer, Hinata Hayashi `charsheet.md`
### Changes
- Age: 34 (-2 yr) to launder XP and hide covert ops work
- Replace "Covert Operations" with "Explorer-themed 3 years"

### Story
- Saw that merc band was going to get Company Store'd into Kurita employ, didn't want that
- Stole from mercs and fled, hence my good equipment
    - It was a relatively sizeable conspiracy by the support staff to screw over the MechWarriors
- Pawned stuff for some cheap trade schooling
- This far into the periphery to keep a low profile
- Enjoy the quiet solo life, or at least claim that I do
