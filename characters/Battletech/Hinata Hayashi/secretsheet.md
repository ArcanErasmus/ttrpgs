- Stole from mercs and fled, hence my good equipment
    - It was a relatively sizeable conspiracy by the support staff to screw over the MechWarriors
- Pawned stuff for some cheap trade schooling
- This far into the periphery to keep a low profile
- Enjoy the quiet solo life, or at least claim that I do
