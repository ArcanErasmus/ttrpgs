## Item Spells
### Magic Missile
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | medium (100 + 10 ft/lvl)
| Target     | up to 5 creatures, no 2 more than 15 ft apart
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile â€“ two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

## Old Entries (for easy reinstatement)

| Area       | cone-shaped burst
| Duration   | instantaneous; see text

A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD.

*2 HD or less*: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)

*3 or 4 HD*: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.

*5 or more HD*: The creature is stunned for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by *color spray*.

### Hydraulic Push (1st)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close (25 + 5 ft/2lvl)
| Target     | one creature or object
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. *Hydraulic push* extinguishes any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected.

### Abundant Ammunition (1st)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a single piece of ammo)
| Target     | one container touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
When cast on a container such as a quiver or a pouch that contains nonmagical ammunition or shuriken (including masterwork ammunition or shuriken, but not special materials, alchemical attributes, or nonmagical treatments on the ammunition) at the start of each round this spell replaces any ammunition taken from the container the round before. The ammunition taken from the container the round before vanishes. If, after casting this spell, you cast a spell that enhances projectiles, such as *align weapon* or *greater magic weapon*, on the same container, all projectiles this spell conjures are affected by that spell.
