## Custom Tradition: The Original Language
### Flavor/Backstory
- study languages, new and old, to find patterns
- by intoning corectly, one can string together sequences to reshape the world
- it all started when I was much younger, and a single, exceedingly unlikely syllable caused a noticeable shift. realization hit me of the power I could wield, and thus began my hunt. I scoured our family archives, seeing the patterns among all languages, and slowly became more in tune with the underlying might of the written, spoken, or even gestured word.
