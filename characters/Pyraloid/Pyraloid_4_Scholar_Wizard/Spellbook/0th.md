# Pyraloid's Spellook - Cantrips

### Acid Splash - conjuration (creation) [acid]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | one missile of acid
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You fire a small orb of acid at the target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The orb deals 1d3 points of acid damage. This acid disappears after 1 round.

### Arcane Mark - universal
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Effect     | one personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.
| Duration   | permanent
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a *detect magic* spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

*See invisibility*, *true seeing*, a *gem of seeing*, or a *robe of eyes* likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A *read magic* spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *erase* spell.

If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.

Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting *instant summons* on the same object (see that spell description for details).

### Detect Magic - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone
| Duration   | C, up to 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
- 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
- 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
- 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

*Detect magic* can be made permanent with a permanency spell

### Disorienting Quake - evocation [force, chaotic]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Fort neg
| SR         | yes
You cause chaotic energies to violently shake and disorient the target of this spell. The target is shaken for 1 round and must make an Acrobatics check (DC 20) or fall prone.

### Jolt - transmutation [electricity]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | spark of electricity
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You cause a spark of electricity to strike the target with a successful ranged touch attack. The spell deals 1d3 points of electricity damage.

### Light - evocation [light]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,M/DF (a firefly)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | object touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius from the point touched, and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.

You can only have one *light* spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent (through *permanency* or a similar effect), it does not count against this limit. *Light* can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.

### Mending - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 10 mins
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 10 ft
| Target     | one object of up to 1 lb/lvl
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the object. If the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of an object must be present for this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than that of the object. Magic items that are destroyed (at 0 hit points or less) can be repaired with this spell, but this spell does not restore their magic abilities. This spell does not affect creatures (including constructs). This spell has no effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can still repair damage done to such items.

### Message - transmutation [language-dependent]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (piece of copper wire)
| Range      | medium
| Target     | one creature/lvl
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path's entire length lies within the spell's range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn't transcend language barriers. To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.

### Open-Close - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (brass key)
| Range      | close
| Target     | object weighing up to 30 lbs. or portal that can be opened/closed
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell's ability to affect.

### Prestidigitation - universal
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 10 ft
| Target     | see text
| Duration   | 1 hr
| Save       | see text
| SR         | no
Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a *prestidigitation* spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. *Prestidigitation* can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a *prestidigitation* spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, *prestidigitation* lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

### Quill - conjuration [creation]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | self
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
This spell conjures a perfectly formed quill pen, usually pure white. The conjured quill has a soft glow. The quill does not need ink; it creates its own as needed. The quill vanishes if it leaves the caster's hand.

### Ray of Frost - evocation [cold]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | ray
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
A ray of freezing air and ice projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of cold damage.

### Read Magic - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
You can decipher magical  inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

*Read magic* can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

### Sand in Your Eyes - conjuration [creation]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (pinch of sand)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature eith eyes
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Fort neg
| SR         | yes
You cause sand to appear in a victim's eyes, inflicting 1 point of slashing damage and blinding the target for 1 round. Creatures who suffer no damage from this spell are immune to the blinding effect.

### Scrivener's Chant - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (fine sand, vial of ink)
| Range      | 5 ft
| Target     | one or more written objects
| Duration   | C, up to 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
This spell imbues a quill with animate energy and rapidly transcribes words from one page to another. The quill copies a written work at the rate of one normal-sized page per minute. The Linguistics skill can be used to make a convincing copy, but otherwise the reproduction is written in the hand of the caster. You must concentrate upon the material being duplicated for the spell's duration and provide new blank pages as required. The scrivener's chant requires blank paper and a quill or other writing materials, in addition to the material components.

### Summarize - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
This spell allows you to quickly summarize a text of up to 250 pages. If a text is over 250 pages, two or more castings of the spell are needed to summarize the entire text. The caster chooses the form of the summary at the time of casting: mental or audible. The summary, in the form of a short paragraph, is either mentally understood at the end of casting or audibly spoken at the end of the spell's casting.

### Unarm Foe - evocation [force]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
This spell allows you to attempt to disarm a creature with a minor blast of force. You make a Combat Maneuver check with your CMB equal to your caster level check plus relevant caster ability modifier. If successful, the defender is disarmed. The object falls to the ground at the defender's feet.
