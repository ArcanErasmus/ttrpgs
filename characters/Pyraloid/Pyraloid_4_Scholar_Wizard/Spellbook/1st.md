# Pyraloid's Spellook - 1st Level

### Air Bubble - conjuration [creation]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S,M/DF (small bladder filled with air)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one creature or one object no larger than a Large 2h weapon
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
Air bubble creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature's head or the touched object. The air bubble allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage. A firearm within an air bubble can be loaded—assuming the black powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight protective device—and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the shot still takes the standard –2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to range. If a firearm within the air bubble explodes, the explosion occurs normally.

### Animate Skeleton - necromancy
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (black onyx worth 50gp, placed in skeleton/corpse's eye socket/mouth; destroyed in casting)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one corpse or skeleton
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell turns the body or bones of a person or creature into a skeleton. This spell will only animate dead creatures of Medium size or smaller. The skeleton can follow the caster and obey the caster's commands or can remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place. The skeleton remains animated until it is destroyed. A destroyed skeleton cannot be reanimated again.

Regardless of the number of times this spell is cast, only a single skeleton from this spell may be controlled at any one time by a single caster. If another skeleton is animated using this spell while another is already under your control, the original becomes uncontrolled.

This undead does not count against your HD limit of controlled undead. An undead skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact skeleton or corpse. If a skeleton is made from a corpse, the flesh falls off the bones.

### Cause Fear - necromancy [emotion, fear, mind-affecting]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one living creature with 5 or fewer HD
| Duration   | 1d4 rds or 1 rd; see text
| Save       | Will partial
| SR         | yes
The affected creature becomes frightened. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round. Creatures with 6 or more HD are immune to this effect. *Cause fear* counters and dispels *remove fear*.

### Color Spray - illusion (pattern)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (red,yellow,blue powder/sand)
| Range      | 15 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped burst
| Duration   | instantaneous; see text
| Save       | Will neg
| SR         | yes
A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD.

*2 HD or less*: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)
*3 or 4 HD*: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.
*5 or more HD*: The creature is stunned for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by *color spray*.

### Detect Secret Doors - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped emanation
| Duration   | C, up to 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
    - 1st Round: Presence or absence of secret doors.
    - 2nd Round: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.
    - Each Additional Round: The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you.

Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

### Feather Fall - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 immediate action
| Components | V
| Range      | close
| Target     | 1 Medium or smaller free-falling object or creature/lvl, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart
| Duration   | until landing or 1 rd/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless or object)
| SR         | yes (object)
The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. *Feather fall* instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

*Feather fall* works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

### Hydraulic Push - evocation [water]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature or object
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. *Hydraulic push* extinguishes any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected.

### Identify - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (wine stirred with an owl's feather)
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped emanation
| Duration   | 3 rd/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell functions as *detect magic*, except that it gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This spell does not allow you to identify artifacts.

### Mage Armor - conjuration [creation]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (piece of cured leather)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | no
An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a *mage armor* spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.

Unlike mundane armor, *mage armor* entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since *mage armor* is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.

### Obscuring Mist - conjuration (creation)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 20 ft
| Effect     | cloud spreads in a 20 ft radius from you, 20 ft high
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a *gust of wind* spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A *fireball*, *flame strike*, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A *wall of fire* burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

### Shield - abjuration [force]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
*Shield* creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of you. It negates *magic missile* attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The *shield* has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.

### Sky Bolt - evocation [electricity]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (copper arrowhead)
| Range      | close
| Target     | three creatures no more than 15 ft apart
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Ref half
| SR         | yes
From your hand springs a blueish bolt of lightning that strikes one target within range and then leaps up to 15 ft. to a second and then a third target. The bolt of lightning deals 1d4 points of electricity damage per caster level up to a maximum of 5d4. A successful reflex save cuts the damage in half.
