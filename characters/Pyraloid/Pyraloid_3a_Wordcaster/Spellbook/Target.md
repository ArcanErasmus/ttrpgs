# Pyraloid's Spellbook - Target Words

## 0th Lvl
### Cone
**Range** - 10 ft
**Target** - A wordspells with this target word affects everything in a cone-shaped burst.
**Boost** - The range increases to 20 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.
**Boost** - The range increases to 40 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 4.

### Personal
**Range** - no range
**Target** - A wordspell with this target word only affects the caster. Effect words that are restricted to this word can be combined with other effect words, but the caster is the only target, regardless of other target possibilities.

### Selected
**Range** - Close
**Target** - A wordspell with this target word affects a single target within range. If the wordspell deals energy damage, this word creates a ray that requires a ranged touch attack to hit, or it can be used as a melee touch attack with no range (decided by the wordcaster when the wordspell is cast). If it is used as a melee touch attack and the attack misses, the wordcaster can hold the charge and try again with subsequent attacks.
**Boost** - Instead of one target, the wordspell affects up to one target per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The range increases to Medium. If used with an effect word that deals energy damage, the wordcaster must make multiple ray attacks for each target (they cannot be made as melee touch attacks). This boosted target word increases the level of all the effect words in the spell by 3 levels.

## 1st Lvl
### Line
**Range** - 20 ft
**Target** - A wordspells with this target word affects everything in a 20-foot line.
**Boost** - The range increases to 60 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 1.
**Boost** - The range increases to 120 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.

### Lobbed
**Range** - Special
**Target** - A wordspell with this target word can be hurled as though it were a thrown splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Attacking a specific square in this manner is a ranged touch attack against the square. Attacking a creature that is in the air or otherwise not attached to a floor, ceiling, wall, or other hard surface in this manner is a ranged touch attack against the touch AC of the creature. If either of these actions results in a miss, the wordspell scatters as does a thrown splash weapon. Wherever the spell lands, it detonates in a 5-foot-radius burst. Some effect words that use the lobbed target word are instead emanations and take up the same radius as an instantaneous effect. These effect words typically have a longer duration and cannot be moved once created. They are noted by the word "emanation" in parentheses after the lobbed (or burst, given compatibility) target restriction. All effect words that are compatible with the burst target word are compatible with the lobbed target word.
**Boost** - The spell has a range increment of 20 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 3.
**Boost** - The spell only suffers a 1 penalty to hit for each range increment. Boosting this target word increases its level by 1.
**Boost** - Wherever the spell lands, it detonates in a 10-foot-radius burst. This target word increases the level of all of the effect words in the spell by 1 level.

### Burst
**Range** - Close
**Target** - A wordspell with this target word affects everything it catches in a 10-foot-radius burst. Some effect words that use the burst target word are instead emanations, taking up the same area as the burst. These effect words typically have a longer duration and cannot be moved once created. They are noted by the word "emanation" in parentheses after the burst target restriction.
**Boost** - The spell affects everything in a 20-foot-radius burst. Its range increases to Medium. Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.
**Boost** - The spell affects everything in a 40-foot-radius burst. Its range increases to Long. Boosting this target word increases its level by 4.

## 2nd Lvl
### Arc
**Range** - Close
**Target** - A wordspell with this target word affects a single creature within range, as well as a single secondary target within 20 feet of the primary target that is also in range. All effect words that deal damage do half damage to the secondary target, while effect words that do not deal damage grant the secondary target a +2 bonus to the appropriate saving throw. The arc target word cannot be the target word of a wordspell wherein any of its effect words are classified as harmless. All harmful effect words that are compatible with the selected target word are compatible with the arc target word; however, the arc target word increases the level of all effect words that are compatible with the selected target word by 1 level.
**Boost** - The spell affects three targets. This tertiary target takes one quarter damage from effect words that deal damage and receives a +4 bonus to the appropriate saving throw against the effects of effect words that do not deal damage. This target word increases the level of all of the effect words in the spell by 2 levels.
**Boost** - Each of the targets of the spell creates a localized explosion of the spell. Each target of the arc target word is now the center of a 5 foot radius burst. This target word increases the level of all of the effect words in the spell by 2 levels.

### Guardian
**Range** - Special
**Target** - A wordspell with this target word affects the caster, as well as a single willing individual within 10 feet of the caster. Should the two recipients of a wordspell with the guardian target word ever be more than 10 feet away from each other, the spell immediately ends for both individuals. All effect words that are compatible with the personal target word are compatible with the guardian target word; however, the guardian target word increases the level of all effect words that are compatible with the personal target word by 2 levels.
**Boost** - Should the two recipients of a wordspell with the guardian target word ever be more than 20 feet away from each other, the spell immediately ends for both individuals. They must still be within 10 feet for the initial casting. Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.

## 3rd Lvl
### Barrier
**Range** - Close
**Target** - A wordspell with this target word creates a visible barrier that is 10 feet long per caster level and 10 feet high. Creatures touching or passing through the barrier are subject to the spell's effect. The barrier does not hindercreatures passing through it unless noted in the spell effect. Creatures occupying the space of the barrier when it forms are subject to the spell's effect. The wall is 1 foot wide and must be anchored on a solid surface. The wall must be straight when formed.
**Boost** - The wall is 20 feet long per caster level and up to 20 feet high. The wall can take on any shape desired by the caster, but it must remain a vertical surface.
