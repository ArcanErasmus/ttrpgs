### Detect Magic
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | VS
| Range      | 60 ft.
| Area       | Cone
| Duration   | C, up to 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
- 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
- 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
- 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

*Detect magic* can be made permanent with a permanency spell

### Read Magic
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | Action
| Components | V,S,F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
You can decipher magical  inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

*Read magic* can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

### Crack
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one object of up to 10 cu. ft., one undead, or construct creature
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will negates (object)
| SR         | yes (object); see text
This spell deals 1d3 points of damage to an object, construct, or undead creature, ignoring hardness and damage reduction.

### Lightning Sand
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)
| Area       | earth or stone in a 5 ft-radius spread
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | Reflex negates
| SR         | no
The very earth becomes shallow lightning sand (dry quicksand); creatures within the area that fail their save gain the entangled condition. Those that end their turn in the area must save again. Creatures that move into the area for the first time must save immediately. Those that fail their save must end their movement and gain the entangled condition. Entangled creatures can attempt to break free as a move action, making a Strength or Escape Artist check. The DC for this check is equal to the DC of the spell. The area of effect is considered difficult terrain while the effect lasts.

Creatures of Large size or larger or those with burrow speeds are immune to the effects of *lightning sand*.

### Stabilize
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 levels)
| Target     | one living creature
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will negates (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has –1 or fewer hit points. That creature is automatically stabilized and does not lose any further hit points. If the creature later takes damage, it continues dying normally.

## 1st Level
### Ant Haul
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a small pulley)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 2 hours/lvl
| Save       | Fortitude negates (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The target's carrying capacity triples. This does not affect the creature's actual Strength in any way, merely the amount of material it can carry while benefiting from this spell. It also has no effect on encumbrance due to armor. If the creature wears armor it still takes the normal penalties for doing so regardless of how much weight the spell allows it to carry.

### Cure Light Wounds (Oracle bonus)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will half (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless); see text
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply Spell Resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

### Disguise Self (Mystery bonus)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl (D)
You make yourself – including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment – look different. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change your creature type (although you can appear as another subtype). Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person or gender.

The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile (touch) or audible (sound) properties of you or your equipment. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on the Disguise check. A creature that interacts with the glamer gets a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.

### Shield of Faith
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (parchment with a holy text written on it)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will negates (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
This spell creates a shimmering, magical field around the target that averts and deflects attacks. The spell grants the subject a +2 deflection bonus to AC, with an additional +1 to the bonus for every six levels you have (maximum +5 deflection bonus at 18th level).

## Item Spells
### Magic Missile
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | medium (100 + 10 ft/lvl)
| Target     | up to 5 creatures, no 2 more than 15 ft apart
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile – two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.
