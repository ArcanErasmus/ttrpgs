### Arcane Mark - universal, lvl 0
From *Forgefather's Hammer* (CL 1)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action, does not provoke
| Components | strike/press hammer against target
| Range      | touch
| Effect     | personal rune or mark, must fit in 1 sq ft
| Duration   | permanent
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a *detect magic* spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

*See invisibility*, *true seeing*, a *gem of seeing*, or a *robe of eyes* likewise allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A *read magic* spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an *erase* spell.

If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.

Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting *instant summons* on the same object (see that spell description for details).

### Make Whole, Greater - transmutation, lvl 4
From *Forgefather's Hammer* (CL 10)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action, does not provoke
| Components | strike hammer against target
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one object of up to 5 lb/lvl or one construct creature of any size
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
This spell repairs 1d6 points of damage plus 1 point per level when cast on an object or construct creature (maximum 10d6+10). Greater make whole can fix destroyed magic items or technological items (items at 0 hit points or fewer), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level at least equal to that of the item. This spell otherwise functions as *make whole*.

#### {*Make Whole* - transmutation, lvl 2} reproduced below:
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 10 minutes
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one object of up to 10 cu ft/lvl or one construct creature of any size
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
This spell functions as *mending*, except that it repairs 1d6 points of damage per level when cast on an object or construct creature (maximum 5d6).

*Make whole* can fix destroyed magic items (at 0 hit points or less), and restores the magic properties of the item if your caster level is at least twice that of the item. Items with charges (such as wands) and single-use items (such as potions and scrolls) cannot be repaired in this way. When make whole is used on a construct creature, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.

## Level 1
### Air Bubble - conjuration (creation), lvl 1
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one creature or one object no larger than a Large 2h weapon
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
*Air bubble* creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature’s head or the touched object. The air bubble allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage. A firearm within an air bubble can be loaded—assuming the black powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight protective device—and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the shot still takes the standard –2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to range. If a firearm within the air bubble explodes, the explosion occurs normally.

### Liberating Command - transmutation, lvl 1
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make an Escape Artist check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a competence bonus on this check equal to twice your caster level (maximum +20). This spell has no effect if the target could not get free by using the Escape Artist skill (for example, if he were under the effects of a *hold person* spell or paralyzed by Strength damage).

### Remove Fear - abjuration, lvl 1
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature + one/4lvls, no 2 can be > 30 ft apart
| Duration   | 10 mins; see text
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
You instill courage in the subject, granting it a +4 morale bonus against fear effects for 10 minutes. If the subject is under the influence of a fear effect when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the duration of the spell.

*Remove fear* counters and dispels *cause fear*.

### Word of Resolve - abjuration, lvl 1
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V
| Range      | close
| Target     | one ally
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
You focus your aura on one ally, allowing it to reroll a failed saving throw against a charm or fear effect with a +4 sacred bonus. If you do not have the aura of courage class ability, this spell has no effect on the target’s fear. If you do not have the aura of resolve class ability, this spell has no effect on any charm effects on the target.

## Level 2
### Shield Other - abjuration, lvl 2
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (pair of platinum rings worth 50 gp total, worn by you and target)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.

If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.
