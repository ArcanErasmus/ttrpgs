### Detect Magic - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone
| Duration   | C, up to 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
- 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
- 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
- 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the infusion indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The infusion can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

*Detect magic* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

### Detect Psychic Significance - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 40 ft
| Area       | 40 ft radius burst, centered on you
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You detect the presence of psychically significant items in your vicinity. Such items are those that might have significant psychic imprints or histories that can be read by the psychometry occult skill unlock, or items under the effects of the charge object or implant false reading spells. Items within range that contain significant psychic energy spark a recognition in your mind’s eye, but no other information is imparted. This spell doesn’t automatically detect magic items or strongly aligned items, though such items often have storied histories and might have had previous owners who possessed psychic abilities.

### Grave Words - necromancy [language-dependent]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 minute
| Components | S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one dead creature
| Duration   | 1 round
With this spell and a touch, you can force a corpse talk to you, but you can’t ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all. The corpse will start babbling for 1 round, spitting out random sentences. There is a 10% chance this information is of some use to the caster, but it is difficult to distinguish whether the information is useful (the GM makes the percentile roll in secret).

Useful information may include warnings about dangers deeper in a dungeon, the command word to a magic item, or even vague and spectral warnings of your or your companions’ future. The GM decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.

Once a corpse has been subject to grave words by any caster, any new attempt to cast grave words on that corpse fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the head of the corpse must have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell doesn’t affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

### Light - evocation [light]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,M/DF (a firefly)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | object touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius from the point touched, and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.

You can only have one *light* spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent (through *permanency* or a similar effect), it does not count against this limit. *Light* can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.

### Read Magic - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
You can decipher magical  inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the infusion is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The infusion allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

*Read magic* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

## 1st lvl
### Identify - divination
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (wine stirred with an owl's feather)
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped emanation
| Duration   | 3 rds/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This infusion functions as *detect magic*, except that it gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This infusion does not allow you to identify artifacts.

### Object Reading - divination
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one touched object
| Duration   | C, up to 1 rd/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You read the psychic impressions left upon an object by emotionally or psychically charged events in the item’s history, or the information imprinted by the charge object or implant false reading spells. This spell returns the same information as the psychometry occult skill unlock, but gives 1 piece of information when cast and requires 1 round of concentration per additional piece of information instead of 1 minute. You must still attempt an Appraise check to see how much information you gain. You gain a +10 competence bonus on the check.

### Psychic Reading - divination
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V
| Range      | close
| Target     | one humanoid creature
| Duration   | 1 rd
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You are able to read a person’s surface thoughts and take cues from the person’s appearance, body language, and manner of speech to infer a great deal of information about the person, even if that person is in disguise (including polymorph effects). When casting the spell, attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive check with a bonus equal to your caster level.

A successful skill check reveals to you one of the following pieces of information of your choice, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds 20: age, alignment, class†, feats†, gender, native language, place of origin, race or ethnicity, racial traits†, religion, sexual orientation, or training in a Craft, Perform, or Profession skill. For items marked with a cross (†), if the target has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as a piece of information.

There’s a 70% chance that all information you receive is correct. This roll is made secretly. Otherwise, on a roll of 71–80, You receive one false piece of information, on a roll of 81–90 you receive two, and on a roll of 91–100 you receive three. You can’t get more false information than the total number of pieces of information you discover.

### Call Spirit - conjuration (calling), lvl 3
| Casting    | 10 minutes
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 10 ft
| Effect     | call the spirit of a single deceased humanoid creature
| Duration   | C
| Save       | Will neg; see text
| SR         | no
You attempt to cause the spirit of a specific individual to manifest from its final resting place. You must request the spirit’s presence by speaking its name.

Unwilling spirits can resist the summons by succeeding at a Will save. If the chosen spirit resists your call, another spirit with malevolent intent almost always takes its place, intent on deceiving you. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to the creature whose spirit you wish to call.

A successfully called spirit manifests as a wispy, vaporous form that vaguely resembles the form the deceased creature had in life. The spirit has the physical attributes of an *unseen servant* and is capable of minor physical manipulations, with the ability to speak in quiet, ghostly whispers in whatever languages the creature knew while it was alive. The spirit isn’t an undead creature, and isn’t beholden to its caller.

Whether you summoned the chosen spirit or a deceitful replacement, the spirit can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you using Bluff, though in either case these spirits can speak about only what they knew in life and have no knowledge of events that occurred after their deaths.

Malevolent spirits might take advantage of their limited physical abilities to cause terrifying spectacles designed to scare the caster.

You must concentrate on maintaining the spell (as a standard action) in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. You can ask a total of one question per caster level; The spirit answers each during the same round. When the spell ends, the spirit’s ectoplasmic form fades and the soul returns to its rest. This spell can’t call the spirits of creatures that are currently undead.
