# Shofen's Poetry
## Fallen foes
1. Eulogy for the snake beasts (Voonith)
    Writhing from the sea
    Streaks of green, screams from ship's crew
    Gleeful scaled hunters
2. Eulogy for the Enchanted Woods pixies (?)
    High up in branches
    Setting traps, laying in wait
    Tiny tree fey
3. Eulogy for Cavandra
    Envoy Cavandra
    Paranoid for a reason
    Smoked in Dylath-Leen
