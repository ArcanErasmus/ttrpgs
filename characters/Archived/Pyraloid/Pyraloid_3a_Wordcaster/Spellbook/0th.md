| Duration | 1 min/lvl
| Save     | none
| SR       | no
| Target R | personal
The target of a wordspell with this effect word can read text written in one particular language, including the language of magic. The caster picks the language when the wordspell is cast. For the duration, the target can read that language as if fluent in it. If the caster chooses magic as the language, the target can decipher scrolls, glyphs, and other magic writing without triggering them. A wordspell with this effect word does not impart the ability to determine what a given language is based on its appearance; the caster must already know the language or guess what language the writing is in to do so.
**Boost** - This effect word can use the selected target word. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.

### Force Block (armor) - abjuration
|----------|--------------
| Duration | 1 rd
| Save     | Will neg (harmless)
| SR       | no
| Target R | personal, selected
The target of a wordspell with this effect word receives a +1 armor bonus to its AC. This armor is made of force and provides protection against the attacks of incorporeal creatures.
**Boost** - A wordspell with this effect word can be cast as an immediate action. In this case, the effect lasts until the end of your next turn. This boost cannot be used if the wordspell includes another effect word (unless that word can also be cast as an immediate action). This boost increases this effect word's level by 1.

### Lift (gravity) - transmutation
|----------|--------------
| Duration | C
| Save     | none
| SR       | yes
| Target R | personal
This effect word grants the caster the ability to lift and move nonmagical objects weighing up to 5 pounds at a distance of up to 25 feet + 5 feet per two levels of the caster. Objects moved by this effect can be moved up to 15 feet per round and cannot be used to make attacks.

### Sense Magic (detection) - divination
|----------|--------------
| Duration | C, up to 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save     | none
| SR       | yes
| Target R | cone
A wordspell with this effect word detects magic auras. By concentrating each round, the caster can determine the number and location of each aura in the target area. He can make a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the school of each aura (one check per aura, the DC of this check is 15 + the spell level or 15 + Â½ the caster level for a nonspell effect). If the aura radiates from a magic item, the caster can attempt to identify the item's properties as if using *detect magic* (see Spellcraft). If the aura emanates from a spell of 7th level or higher, or is a nonspell effect with a caster level of 12th or higher, the caster knows that the aura is strong, even if the Knowledge check to identify the school is unsuccessful.

### Spark (electricity) - evocation [electricity]

### Torch (illumunation) - evocation [fire]

| Duration | 1 min/lvl
| Save     | none
| SR       | no
A wordspell containing this effect word causes the light within 10 feet to increase by 1 step (darkness becomes dim light, dim light becomes normal light, and normal light becomes bright light). If the target word is either burst or cone, that area plus the 10 feet around that area increases by 1 step.
**Boost** - The light increases by 2 levels instead of 1. Additionally, in the 20 feet surrounding the area where the light is increased by 2 levels, light is increased by 1 level. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 2.
