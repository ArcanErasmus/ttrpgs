# Pyraloid's Journal

## Backstory
- child of archivists: parents focused on library-building
    - Corcyra (elf mother) and Papiliona (changeling mother)
    - settled in current city long ago, when it was a more minor trading hub
    - for a couple centuries Corcyra has been collecting documents, museum-pieces, and magic items
    - she sells access to research materials for a fee, rent/sell items
    - Papiliona has passed away many decades ago
    - Corcyra's current loose romantic/business partner is Aureopteri, another elf in Segovia
- cooperation with thieves guild:
    - at first, they had some friction, with the guild extorting some "fire insurance" money
    - paying for "protection" quickly turned into paying for *actual* protection, to secure the valuable collection
    - as they became more friendly with the guild, more guild members began paying for collection access themselves, for intel gathering
    - covertly, parents began expanding their intel collection, often hiring guild members to procure items or to keep them abreast of rumors and movements
- where do i come in?
    - grew up with magic training, reading from tons of random works
    - crossbow training with some of the archive guards from thieves' guild
    - started helping guild more directly: translations, intel, go with them to locate important works
    - more daring missions: negotiations, even some thefts and fights (not always exactly pre-approved by parents)
    - worked with Jass on several occasions

## Quest Log
- task: acquire a special sword, bring it to Fabricus, the leader of the Segovia thieves' guild
    - description: bronze, silver inlay, on the inlay a releif of serpentine creatures being slain, perfect/very good condition
    - progress:
        - sword found, weilded by the tiny kobold crusader Braveheart
        - the sword is in extremely poor condition however, so it is likely a similar make but not the one we were to retreive
- task: retrieve child from spook house
    - self-loathing manuscript of love story between some utter dope and the general of an army
    - goop writing
        "he swallowed his fear and rode off to the enemy encampments"
        "guided by his love and against all odds, he managed to rout the enemy and save the general"
        "and so he never saw his love again"
        (outline of a face on a mirror, smeared out with handprint)
    - portrait of Neil "Nitrous" O'Shaqspeare
    - bust of the general
    - journal of NO'S
