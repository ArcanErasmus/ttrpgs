| Target     | up to 5 creatures, no 2 more than 15 ft apart

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile â€“ two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

## Old Entries - 1st lvl
### Abundant Ammunition - conjuration [summoning]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a single piece of ammo)
| Target     | one container touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
When cast on a container such as a quiver or a pouch that contains nonmagical ammunition or shuriken (including masterwork ammunition or shuriken, but not special materials, alchemical attributes, or nonmagical treatments on the ammunition) at the start of each round this spell replaces any ammunition taken from the container the round before. The ammunition taken from the container the round before vanishes. If, after casting this spell, you cast a spell that enhances projectiles, such as *align weapon* or *greater magic weapon*, on the same container, all projectiles this spell conjures are affected by that spell.

### Dancing Darkness - evocation [darkness, shadow]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | medium
| Effect     | Up to 4 spheres, all within a 10 ft radius area
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You create either up to four spheres of darkness that each reduce the illumination level by one step within a 20-foot-radius, or one dimly lit, vaguely humanoid shape. Each sphere must stay within a 10-foot-radius area of one another but can otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like.

The darkness can move up to 100 feet per round. The effect winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.

This spell can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

### Deadeye's Arrow - evocation [electricity]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (one arrow/bolt)
| Range      | medium
| Effect     | arrow of electricity
| Duration   | instantaneous or 1 rd (see text)
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You create an arrow made of crackling electricity, which you may use for one of two effects.

- *Attack*: You may throw the arrow up to Medium range or fire it from a bow up to the bow's maximum range. Either use is a ranged touch attack. The arrow deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point per level (maximum +5).

- *Beacon*: You throw or fire the arrow straight up. When it reaches maximum range or a solid surface (such as the roof of a cave) it explodes in a peal of thunder and forms a forked bolt of electricity resembling Erastil's holy symbol, which lingers for 1 round. The thunder and lightning are as loud and bright as natural thunder and lightning, but they do not harm any nearby creatures

### Expeditious Retreat - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).

### Snowball - conjuration (creation) [cold, water]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | one ball of ice and snow
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Fort partial (see text)
| SR         | no
You conjure a ball of packed ice and snow that you can throw at a single target as a ranged touch attack. The snowball deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 5d6) on a successful hit, and the target must make a successful Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round.

### Vanish - illusion (glamer)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl, max 5 (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
This spell functions like *invisibility*, except the effect only lasts for 1 round per caster level (maximum of 5 rounds). Like *invisibility*, the spell immediately ends if the subject attacks any creature.

### Web Bolt - conjuration (creation)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | fist-sized blob of webbing
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Reflex neg (see text)
| SR         | no
You launch a ball of webbing at a target, which must make a save or be affected as if by a *web* spell occupying only the creature's space. If the creature saves or breaks free of the webbing, the remaining webs dissolve and the square is not considered difficult terrain. The spell has no effect if the target is not on or adjacent to a solid surface that can support the webbing.

Rules from *Web*:
The target must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is unaffected. If the save fails, the creature gains the grappled condition, but can break free by making a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this spell.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. A flaming weapon can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn them away. The webbed creature takes 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.
