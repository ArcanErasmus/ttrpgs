### Blade Lash - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | your melee weapon
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
Your weapon elongates and becomes whip-like. As part of casting this spell, you can use this weapon to attempt a trip combat maneuver against one creature within 20 feet, and you gain a +10 bonus on your roll, after which the weapon returns to its previous form.

### Color Spray - illusion (pattern)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (red,yellow,blue powder/sand)
| Range      | 15 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped burst
| Duration   | instantaneous; see text
| Save       | Will neg
| SR         | yes
A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious. Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD.

*2 HD or less*: The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)
*3 or 4 HD*: The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.
*5 or more HD*: The creature is stunned for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by *color spray*.

### Feather Fall - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 immediate action
| Components | V
| Range      | close
| Target     | 1 Medium or smaller free-falling object or creature/lvl, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart
| Duration   | until landing or 1 rd/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless or object)
| SR         | yes (object)
The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. *Feather fall* instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects, and so forth.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

*Feather fall* works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

### Hydraulic Push - evocation [water]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature or object
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. *Hydraulic push* extinguishes any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected.

### Obscuring Mist - conjuration (creation)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 20 ft
| Effect     | cloud spreads in a 20 ft radius from you, 20 ft high
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a *gust of wind* spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A *fireball*, *flame strike*, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A *wall of fire* burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

### Ray of Enfeeblement - necromancy
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | ray
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl
| Save       | Fort half
| SR         | yes
A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject's Strength score cannot drop below 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this penalty by half. This penalty does not stack with itself. Apply the highest penalty instead.

### Shield - abjuration [force]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
*Shield* creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of you. It negates *magic missile* attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The *shield* has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.

### Shocking Grasp - evocation [electricity]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature or object touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal).

### Thunderstomp - evocation [earth]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You stomp your foot or strike your weapon against the ground or floor, creating a ripple of power that you can use to trip a creature. Attempt the combat maneuver check to trip the target, but instead of your base attack bonus you can use your caster level, and instead of your Strength modifier you can use your spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for magi and wizards; Wisdom for druids and rangers; Charisma for bloodragers and sorcerers). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This spell has no effect if you cannot reach the ground or floor, or if your target is not in contact with the ground or floor.

### True Strike - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,F (small wooden replica of an archery target)
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | see text
You gain temporary, intuitive insight into the immediate future during your next attack. Your next single attack roll (if it is made before the end of the next round) gains a +20 insight bonus. Additionally, you are not affected by the miss chance that applies to attackers trying to strike a concealed target.

### Waterproof - abjuration [water]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one touched creature or one touched obj up to 10 lbs/lvl
| Duration   | 24 hrs
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
This spell renders a touched object waterproof for the duration of the spell. The object must be no larger than 10 pounds per caster level. The spell protects the object from any mundane liquids (such as alcohol or oil) but not from magically created liquids.

If this spell is cast on a creature, all of that creature's equipment is rendered waterproof as long as it is carried by the target creature. If the creature drops or discards an item, the item is no longer protected by this spell, even if the targeted creature picks it up later.

Mundane combustibles under the effects of this spell still need exposure to air in order to ignite.
