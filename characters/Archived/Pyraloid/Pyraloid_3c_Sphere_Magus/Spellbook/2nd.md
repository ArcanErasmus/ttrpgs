## Not Yet Known
### Acid Arrow - conjuration (creation) [acid]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach), F (a dart)
| Range      | long
| Effect     | one arrow of acid
| Duration   | 1 + 1rd/3lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
An arrow of acid springs from your hand and speeds to its target. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to hit your target. The arrow deals 2d4 points of acid damage with no splash damage. For every three caster levels you possess, the acid, unless neutralized, lasts for another round (to a maximum of 6 additional rounds at 18th level), dealing another 2d4 points of damage in each round.

### Glitterdust - conjuration (creation)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (ground mica)
| Range      | medium
| Area       | creatures and objects within 10 ft-radius spread
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (blinding only)
| SR         | no
A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end of their turn blinded creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a -40 penalty on Stealth checks.

### Greater Detect Magic - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped emanation
| Duration   | C, up to 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell functions as *detect magic*, except that you can glean much more information from the magical auras that you find, and those auras can be found after a much greater length of time. You can detect a lingering aura for up to 1 day per caster level you have, regardless of the aura's original strength.

Additionally, when you use a standard action to concentrate on this spell, you can also study a creature within the spell's area and attempt a Spellcraft check in order to determine the last spell that the creature cast by identifying lingering traces that the spell left in the caster's aura. The DC to identify the spell is equal to 20 + the creature's caster level.

Finally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it. In order to find these identifiers in a spell's aura, you must spend 1 round focusing on that spell in particular, and succeed at an opposed Knowledge (arcana) check against the caster (or a Knowledge [arcana] check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level if the caster wants her work to be identified and emphasizes these unique elements rather than obscuring them). Once you learn a caster's set of identifiers, you can remember them as easily as a face or a voice. You can recognize this signature if you succeed at a Spellcraft check when later identifying a spell to determine whether or not that spell was cast by the same individual. The spell *greater magic aura* can obfuscate this information, making it seem that someone else cast the spell. *Greater detect magic* grants a saving throw against *magic aura* (but not *greater magic aura*).

### Invisibility - illusion (glamer)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
| Range      | personal or touch
| Target     | you or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lbs/lvl
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)/(harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless)/(harmless, object)
The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as *bless* that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

*Invisibility* can be made permanent (on objects only) with a *permanency* spell.

### Night Shield - illusion (shadow) [shadow]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
Your shadow flows up as a swirling barrier, moving to intercept long-range attacks. The night shield protects you from *magic missile* spells, as a *shield* spell. In addition, the shadow deflects a single ranged weapon attack each round. This functions similarly to the Missile Shield feat, though you do not need to be wearing a shield to deflect the attack (the night shield does it for you). This deflected attack is in addition to the one ranged attack you can deflect each round with the Missile Shield feat, if you have it normally. The same limitations of Missile Shield, such as being unable to deflect siege weapons or natural attacks, applies to the night shield.

### Raven's Flight - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 swift action
| Components | V
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 rd
You can cast this spell only if it is the first action you take on your turn. In a burst of shadowy feathers, you turn into a Tiny blurred shape reminiscent of a black raven until the beginning of your next turn. You gain a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability, and apply appropriate size modifiers (though your ability scores don't change). Until the beginning of your next turn, you can take only the 5-foot step, move, run, or withdraw actions. If the spell is dispelled while you are still aloft, the power of flight dissipates slowly; you float downward 60 feet on your next turn, then fall any remaining distance.

### Scorching Ray - evocation [fire]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | 1 or more rays
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You blast your enemies with a searing beam of fire. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.
