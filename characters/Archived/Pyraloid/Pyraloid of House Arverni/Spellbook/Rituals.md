# Pyraloid's Occult Rituals
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-rules/occult-rituals

## Ideas
### Infernal Regeneration
- School: Conjuration (healing) [evil]
- Level: 4
- Casting Time: 20 to 40 mins, 20 mins finisher
- Components: V,S,M (Devil's Blood), M2 (diamond dust worth 100gp or 1000gp), SC (up to 4)
- Skill Checks: Kn (Planes) DC 28, 1 success; Kn (Arcana or Religion) DC 28, 1 success; Spellcraft DC 28, 2 success
- Extra Checks: Kn (Arcana or Religion) DC 28 (if ritual goes longer than 40 minutes)
- Range: Touch
- Target: Creature in circle
- Duration: instantaneous
- Saving Throw: Will neg (harmless)
- SR: none
- Backlash: Subject and primary caster radiate aura as evil cleric for 1 min per rd of ritual
- Finisher Backlash: All casters become exhausted
- Failure: Subject and primary caster take 1d3 Con damage
- Finisher Failure: Subject and primary caster gain 1 temporary negative level
- Main Portion: The ritual begins with scribing a circle around the subject creature, or to place the creature inside, which is a full-round action (arguably longer for very large creatures). The first check is always Kn (arcana/religion), made when the circle is drawn. Future checks are made every 10 minutes afterwards. If successful, the subject immediately stabilizes if currently dying. Once any successful check has been made for the ritual, as long as it is maintained, the subject immediately stabilizes if they would otherwise begin dying. Beginning the round after the first successful check is made, the subject gets Fast Healing 1, which lasts until the main part of the ritual is ended. At any point at least 20 minutes into the ritual, the primary caster can proceed to the Finisher.
- Finisher (optional): If the primary caster chooses to proceed to the Finisher, they scatter diamond dust worth 100 or 1000gp, and continue the ritual for 20 more minutes. The "finisher backlash" is suffered, and the "finisher failure" is suffered if the ritual is failed during this portion. Advancing to the Finisher advances the skill check time increment so that a check must be made immediately, with one more check required 10 minutes later as usual. The subject is immediately healed of any magical effects reducing its ability scores, as well as all temporary ability damage. The subject is also cured of any fatigue or exhaustion. At the conclusion of the ritual, any temporary levels are dispelled from the subject. Also, all permanent ability drain is removed from one of the subject's ability scores. If 1000gp of diamond dust was scattered at the start of the finisher, instead of dispelling all temporary levels, one permanent negative level is dispelled. This ritual cannot be used to dispel more than one permanent negative level on a single subject in a 1-week period.

### Infernal Restoration, lvl 4
- Combine Infernal Healing with Restoration
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/infernal-healing
- creating the ritual circle (succeeding the first check) stabilizes the health of a single dying creature placed inside it (no effect if not dying)
- maintaining the ritual (probably making one of the required checks every so many rounds) gives the target fast healing 1
- the healing continues as long as the ritual is maintained
- backlash might also be continual, or even ramp up?
- failure penalty is minor
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration
- ramp up the ritual with $$$ components
- backlash and failure at this stage is higher
- maybe up to like lvl 5 ritual

### Sacrificial Offering, lvl 4
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/malediction
- perfect as a super easy no backlash ritual, just making simple offering to deity
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-rules/occult-rituals/rituals-from-other-publishers/petersen-games-rituals/mao-ceremony
- if you want to push your "blessings" further, you instead siphon the power into spell slots

### Raise Skeleton Underlings, lvl 4
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead
- can impart profession skills, with appropriate skill checks
- https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/skeleton-crew
- maybe they get your profession + 5
