# Scepter Tower of Spellgard - part 1
## Overview
- "30-40 hrs"
- Ideal for lvl 2, takes chars up to lvls 4-5

## GM notes
- Pacing is key, keep play moving (ignore advice on being too fast, we are always slow)
- Give appropriate hints; always indicate conditions/bloodied on opponents
- Leveling mid-adventure is OK
- Half XP for failing an encounter (combat or skill challenge), if they beat it later then give the other half (personally I would award more, you learn more from failure)
- Char death: 500gp plus Raise Dead ritual, 20% more if hiring someone to cast it for them (or let it be meaningful, it's on the party)
- Milestones: only XP encounters count, happens after every 2nd encounter since extended rest

## The Adventure Hook
### Each character has a question they wish to ask Lady Saharel
- Can I adapt this? I don't feel that characters *have* this burning need (perhaps Sinnafein does)
### Segue out of prev adventure
- No longer extremely welcome in the city, and uncomfortable besides
- ...NPC escort quest???
    - Hiring the party bc they have a question they NEED answered
    - Half cash upfront, PCs can have all the rewards

## The Adventure
### Welcome to the Adventure
- Players brave a fortress of Lost Netheril, for treasure and Lady Saharel's prophecy
    - Lady Saharel appears occasionally within the ruins
    - One of few structures standing after Spellgard's fall
- Combat heavy, but social is useful
