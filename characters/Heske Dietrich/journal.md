# Heske "Hunch" Dietrich's Journal
## Personality
- Where are you from?
Altdorf.
- What is your family like?
Father is a miner, mother a housemaid. Two older brothers joined dad in the mines, I didn't want to lose my lungs like dad.
- What was your childhood like?
Mainly cared for by older brothers, not that they had much time.
- Why did you leave home?
Had to earn a living, so I joined up with the military. With the treason of the baron in Ubersreik, the army was moved in to dispose the nobles and restore order.
- Who are your best friends?
I have a couple of squad buddies that I can count on to have my back when we're out on patrol, even if we would gladly push each other into a dung heap for a laugh.
- What is your greatest desire?
Stop having to take shit and say "yes sir" for the privilege. I want to be the one giving the orders.
- What are your best and worst memories?
Worst: Getting screamed at for 2 hours while massively hungover after a blue falcon snitched on me for pissing in the asshole sergeant's boots.
Second best: Pissing in the asshole sergeant's boots. Best: beating the shit out of that snitch.
- What are your religious beliefs?
The continued bad luck that Sigmar hands me is my penance for laziness. I can apologize all I want, but I need to get off my ass and fix the disrespect problem that this force has.
- To whom, or what, are you loyal?
First of all, I gotta carve out my own. But beyond that, I serve the Empire. If only I could clean up the swamp that is filled with these snooty bureaucrats...
- Why are you adventuring?
My enlistment term is up soon, so I can basically do whatever. Unless I massively screw up, they won't go to the trouble of a dd. Advancement in the corps is too slow even for those who kiss ass all day. Who knows, maybe with a little grit and a lot of luck, I can somehow climb to governor of a town like Ubersreik. Still working on a plan for that one though...
- How do you feel about your destiny?
I figure Sigmar handed out my doom when I was a little punk, and there are so many people in the Empire, he hasn't paid me any notice since. I'll pull off a grand plan one day and he might re-evaluate. Something like "surrounded by my lovers, happy and at peace, after a long life." Yeah, that would be nice.

## Appearance
I'm short, got gray eyes, and greasy red-blonde hair in a ragged crew cut. Covered in the callouses you'd expect from military work, and the perfect, shiny white teeth from military work (hah).

## Contacts/Friends
- Old army friends

## History
Active Quests:
- Gurkenfeld is very learned, paranoid. Giant sealed door with a ton of locks, ballista aimed straight at it. Knows Khazalid, (secret lang of dwarves), very educated on dwarves. Very well-connected in Altdorf. Theater overlooks the Marketplatz, possibly where the "shot that killed the bard" came from. Asking for a "stay of rent" for BWWC. Both Rudi and Captain Pfeffer mentioned increasing numbers of disappearances lately, focused around the docks and nearby both sides of the river. We were tasked with investigating, and the occurrences being on both sides of the river suggests kidnappers operating from the river itself, and boats would certainly be a route to smuggle out victims. Giant corpse-smelling lizardman, necklace of skulls, wielding an old fat anchor, slowly searching its way north up the main road from the Marketplatz, toward the river. Gurkenfeld: "The Teuful Terror", it used to stalk the streets, old wives' tale. It really likes singing morbid dirges. TT has a nasty long tail lash, and agile climbing. We ran to the docks in hopes of planning a defense/ambush, and happened to find a warehouse of Jungfreud-stamped weapons crates. We managed to severely wound the TT, and it fled into the river.

- Duchess Elanor Asschaffenburg invited us to her place for a Watch request. She has been hearing sounds like someone mining under the manor, potentially from the sewers. Ratcatchers said it's not rats, therefore not their problem, so we were called in. Noises happen every night, and only rarely during daylight hours, for about two weeks now. We headed to the Morgenseite sewers, where we immediately ran into goblins. After some hasty exchange of blows, Lukas managed to make peace with them, and we followed one of their number, [unnamed], to Stinkstaff Gong-Tongue. One of them, Gorkanaut, claimed he entered the city over 200 years ago, when Emperor Magnus the Pious was away fighting Chaos. Our plan was to hide the goblins in the JF weapons crates, and once they get loaded and removed, we swoop in and take down the dockside smugglers.

- Judge Melierte presided over the rest of the group's trial, and the sentencing to the Watch was supposedly "hardline" (seems pretty progressive to me). We had only a handful of minutes before the dinner was to be ready, so socializing would have to be quick. Osanna Winandus (baliff? lawyer?), was trying to convince the young Alfred Karstadt to focus on his reading (learning to read). She seems to know something about upcoming events, and is concerned about it (and seemed to be concerned for me). Osanna was from Altdorf. She is sad about the group being the scapegoats for some heavy charges, and while she understands that they were necessary to pacify the JFs (as opposed to more hangings), she did not realize the Watch actually put hard work in. Lady Hellen put Cpt Pfeffer in charge. Kurlass Meingot, merchant, knows a curious amount about the fortress-like architecture of the estate buildings.  Looking to make a power play to secure control over ____, in negotiations with the Dwarves. He is quite "cat-tongued", be careful of him. BWWC are here, were sentenced to be ratcatchers. Of course Gurkenfeld is here, already in a screaming match with Detlef and Genevieve. Detlef has more supernatural shenanigans going on, aging unusually well seeing as he is as old as Gurkenfeld. Their rivalry stemmed from a play (Detlef had the lead role as Magnus, and Benedict was Sigmar), where an incident with stage pulleys caused either Gurkenfeld to fall or something to fall on him, crushing/breaking his leg. Gurkenfeld blames Detlef for it, and despite his eccentricities, the evidence leans in his favor.

Leads:
- Gurkenfeld informed us of something that sliced/melted through all of his locks, about a week ago.
- Witch hunters are about, and do not care about Watch authority.
- Durak's halberd is a "thirsting blade", dangerous to wielder as well as foe. "The Black Halberd", Defensive, Hack, Impale, +10 damage. Dwarven gift to Man, ???.
- Investigate the witch hunters.
- Investigate the suspicious moon phase (time passage?). We left Grauner, but we may still look for clues.
- Night watch duty, night of Morrisleb's moon (full green moon). Associated with spooky things.
- Odd characters at the dockside.
- Perdi has some business with the Baron, that she has fulfilled her end of the bargain. Told to us by The Eel, an emaciated, slimy-looking beggar with vibrantly blue eyes. The Eel is in the baron's service, looking for smugglers (JF weapons?). Eel has a JF symbol, The Shifting Grasp.
- Rudi's breastplate, painted-over embossing of antlers, in blue and silver (the insignia of House Jungfreud)

My plans for advancement:
- Gavrich is working to smooth things over with the Empire and throw the Baron under the bus
- I have laid the seeds of doubt in Rudi's ability to manage the whole of the guardsmen so directly
- Rudi has left me some potential blackmail in the form of his repainted breastplate that used to be in Jungfreud service. This could be easily downplayed as looted, though that might not go over well with the Captain. However, if I could prove (or bluff that I can prove) that he was in the employ of the Jungfreuds, I might be able to *convince* him to resign early.

Rumors:
- Swamp monster outside of town
- "Goblins in the sewers"

Log:
- My introduction: After being transferred to the guard from the Altdorf army, following the rioting and the takeover from the Jungfreuds, I was assigned to watch over the new recruits (the rest of the party). We quickly found ourselves on equal footing, despite the original pretense of my seniority, and their having been pressed into service to avoid prison time.

- Our first assignment was to head to the temple of Ulrich to speak to Denfather Holst Ketchmer, who put in a request for assistance to Rudi. He asked us to find Reikhardt Gestaltenstark, and convince him to quiet his proselytizing against Sigmar. We were informed that he is a pit fighter at the Tin Spur, and has the attitude to match, but that we might seek an "in" through his friends. We were warned by fellow watchmen to avoid a masked woman who looked to be trouble, and was also asking after Reikhardt. We made little progress with him until the woman showed up and suddenly attacked, shooting at him (and nearly hitting me!). She turned out to be a Witch Hunter, operating alone and potentially outside their organization. On her body was a fancy dagger with specific markings possibly worth investigating (among other general loot). Reikhardt reveals his secret to us, the ability to shapeshift into a wolf, and heal unnaturally fast. We were left with an open invite to join the Spur as fighters, should we want to.

- Went on patrol with Rudi to the docks. Informed to fear and respect the Boatbuilder's Guild (they have an attitude and the fists to match). There was an argument between Stevedores and a captain. The captain was waiting on his men who went missing (they were wearing green and gold, should we spot them), but refused to pay for the Stevedores' help. He received a serious beating and mugging (and it was implied that the Stevedores pay the watch to let them handle their "justice" without interference). The Stevedores might have had a hand in the "missing" men? As we left the docks, we came across a fire at the butcher shop and neighboring tenements. After organizing a bucket brigade to contain the fire, we learned that it was intentionally started by the butcher, who was blackmailed into it. A group of thieves attempted to pickpocket us as we were there, and we gave chase. Some daring acrobatics later, we had them subdued and dragged back to the Rusty Raven, to their boss Silvi Kreutzhame (and possibly Gert Hunder?). Silvi asked us to throw out some overly rowdy Reikland soldiers. The "leader" of the group, Rupert et Sigismund, got into a drinking contest with Tylos. While he lost the contest (being quite drunk when it began), he ended it by throwing a rib-cracking punch to Tylos's chest, before falling of his stool and passing out. We headed to the temple of Shallya to get Tylos some medical help, and Silvi had us take her broach to give to Marianne Altenbaum, the high priestess there, as payment for services. Tylos was given a potion and passed out, spending the night there.

- I went to the temple of Sigmar for advice with my wavering faith. After receiving some guidance, I was invited by priestess Irma Brantl to stay for midnight services (as Festag was the next day). I accepted, and left with renewed conviction and confidence in my duties and Sigmar. As I returned to the barracks, I was given a tip off by a fellow guardsman that I would be sent down the river in the morning to Grauner. The Captain received a request from veteran (and Altdorf army buddy of mine) Gavrich Bloch, to assist with training a village militia.

- We took a boat down to Grauner. Villagers of note: Sebastion Bloche, father of Gavrich; Berthilda Hebamme, widower and leader of Women's Council. We gave the townsfolk lessons on various military/watch skills, and went to celebrate in the tavern. The bailiff, Parzival Reisefuhrer (who forbade the people from forming a military), unexpectedly showed up. During our celebrations, beastmen attacked the town. 2 were killed and they fled, but to the east, where we know there are more villagers (who were now in danger). Grovefather Elgolor offered to purify the corruption from our looted gear. We gathered a mob to head eastward in chase of the beastmen, and destroyed the beastman camp, but lost many of the villager militia. As we returned, we found the bailiff had rounded up the Grovefather and four village women (who appeared to have been tortured for information), and executed them. This incited an uprising from the villagers, who we joined in storming and killing the bailiff and his mercenary handgunners. The bailiff had a letter on him from the baron, ordering the arrest of us Ubersreik guardsmen, and warning of a growing cult of Khorn in Grauner. We returned the looted beastmen (and late militia) weapons to the town, and left them to storm the baron's manor, as we returned to Ubersreik. While we left behind the opportunity to investigate the supernatural happenings surrounding Berthilda, Gavrich came with us. He continued onwards to Altdorf, where he will hopefully succeed in his plan to implicate the (likely now deceased) baron in said cult, and reverse the narrative...

- Benedict Gurkenfeld used to be an actor, but broke his leg in a stage fall, and repeatedly aggravated it. The lengthy recovery put him out of acting and on harder times, so he moved to Ubersreik to set up the Theatre Varieté. He has a rivalry with (but no personal animosity to) Betse Wooster['s Wondrous Cavalcade] (BWWC). Gurkenfeld has fallen on hard times as few want to go to the play, especially now. He made enemies with old colleague Detlef Sierck & Genevieve Dieudonné, by aggressively rebuffing Sierck's offer of charity (in the form of a play to put on) and insulting his wife. Gurkenfeld was then attacked by Sierck (with possibly inhuman strength), right as we arrived. He has been renting out his space in the evenings to "strange people" from in and out of town, for unknown business. He rented it a few days before the marketplatz riots to a strange man with a tattoo of an eel being held above the waves by a clenched hand (he paid not to say anything, but Gurkenfeld has a loose tongue). The man said something about "sale of stolen weapons", and was moving a bunch of crates. We wandered far from marketplatz while talking to Gurkenfeld, and had to escort him home with haste, as Morrisleb's moon was rising. We were surprised by a clinking sound, and two bobbing lights from the river, with a deep voice ominously singing "Bones and boards go crunch and creak. Littlefolk's all fast asleep." Gurkenfeld loudly exclaimed his recognition of this song. And thus began our encounter with the Teuful Terror.

- Josef Specht (herald from the trial) came to see our Watch squad. We were invited to a party at the Karstadt estate ("the red pick on the yellow and blue field"). It was to begin in merely 90 minutes, so we had to assemble and clean up with haste. With the Jungfreuds out, House Karstadt (led by Lady Hellen Karstadt-Stampf) is the highest non-nobility in the town, and would make a valuable connection. They are miners, and more recently moneylenders, with offices in Altdorf, and own the Ubersreik bank. They are starting to edge out the dwarves in mining operation efficiency, though they would like to keep their heads down around the other nobility. They sold their nobility for significant fortune, which has been a big financial boost. Rumor has it that Lady Hellen had information about the coming JF downfall, so avoided getting tied to them. We were led by Jervais the Butler around the back, to a secret entrance in the wall (presumably a servants' entrance). Annika Karstadt (young child, holding a scepter, possibly heir?) walked in on the men bathing (and then us being measured) and then ran away screaming. We ran into Lady Glazer, and an elf (jester? an Asrai) while being measured. The Asrai were high elves that stayed behind in the old world, and are now known as green elves or wood elves. We were greeted by Lady Hellen, and given fine garb. And thus the socializing really began.

Questions for other players:

- Who plans to stay in the watch past your term?
- 

Durak (Elijah) - ABSENT
- Where did you come from before you ended up in Ubersreik?
- What is your faith? Moor
- What is your plan in the watch?


Tylos (Alex)
- Where did you come from before you ended up in Ubersreik?
- What is your faith? Ranal
- What do you plan to do post-watch?

Gammy (Caoimhe)

- What is your faith?
- What do you plan to do post-watch?

go see the lawyer, Osana Winandus:
Not every test we endure is demanded, or even asked, of us. You may have put them in the Watch, but did not force them through such labors. Ubersreik pleads for help from us all. It was all of our *choices* to answer the call. I know firsthand that to uphold the law is a dance that requires strange steps. You may have done more than you realize to prevent further unrest in the city.

Meta questions:
- What are Lady Karstadt's plans, and how do they involve us?
- How treasonous are they going to be?
- What's in it for us?

- Karstadts - money and production
- Watch - enforcement
- Judge and Osana - legal
- Gurkenfeld - minor mover, easily manipulated
- Sierck and Gierdonné - propaganda and influence in Altdorf
- Meingot - informants (cult of Ranald), shipping
- Lady Glazer - old friend of Lady Karstadt, general connections

Assuming Hunch doesn't bite it or fuck up during the smuggler bust, as to lose the favor/protection of Lady Karstadt, I would like to retire her into an NPC within the Karstadt sphere. Unless there is more politics and action going on that it would be more than reasonable for her to take part in, she could be a possible encounter for future players in Ubersreik, if they run into the law. Alternately, they could use Hunch as an in to depose Lady Karstadt, assuming it would put Hunch in a higher position.
