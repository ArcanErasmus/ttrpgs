## Legacy Path - Where did they come from?
Zealous sovcit space pirate enclave that settled on Phoenix-2 before WY began expanding on it

[20] TRANSCEND - Long ago, your region was the site of a massive extraplanar event.
- What realms collided and what ensued?
    Outlaw survivalist group collides with the terraforming of the planet. The survivalist group was formed from those fleeing the UPP's expansion, believing in independence and free enterprise, but having run into trouble with every political entity through piracy and worse crimes. It was the height of miserable irony for them to be wiped out by corporate negligence when the AACs failed. Off-planet during the Catastrophe, blindsided upon return by the changed situation. Tried to sneak on-planet to make it to her family, but was captured and thrown into indentured servitude for as many of the family-society's crimes could be blamed on her.
- What caused it?
    WY terraforming slowly expands, but is of at most distant concern to the enclave. The AAC failure completely blindsides the group, a sudden failure of atmosphere and massively worsened weather obliterates the group.
- Are there relics or reminders of what happened around still?
    The ruins of their settlements can be found amidst the abraded and sunken wreckage that litters the planet. Perhaps, however, a small group of them still live, having retreated in time to their only partially-cannibalized spaceships.
- What stories do people tell about what happened to this day?
    There are rumors aplenty, but their own society fades into the background of other lost ruins, their histories forgotten. Temporary scrapper settlements, a crushed native group who lived here for hundreds of years, mutinous employees sold out by one of their number, infamous space pirates who took refuge before vanishing to the stars once more, elites who "went native" and built a fragile society founded on the roleplay until they collapsed.

## Bond Path - Who was an impactful person in their life thus far?
Sephis Morris-Lou, the work crew lead who cared for the team during the eight years that Zeela toiled on her duties, as she tried to get transfered to a scrapper team.

[19] WATCHER - One who stands in silent guard over a place worthy of protection.
- Was this charge given to them by others or did they choose it?
    Took command to instill stability amongst their team, to encourage the proper attitudes to survive and reach freedom.
- What do they defend against?
    Infighting, bringing down attention from their overseers, and burnout.
- How well do they shoulder this responsibility?
    A real political wishy-washy centrist, they kept people focused on the job in front of them. Never able to really change anyone's minds, they were at least usually good at de-escalation and helping their crew keep from accruing further infractions.
- What have you seen them accomplish already?
    Assisted Zeal-Of-The-Land in finding a crew, kept others away from her while she learned to hold her own.

## Catalyst Path - What was an event that set them forward on their journey?
God sent me this crew to help me return to my family. He provides me a further test: Can I survive the grueling missions and rough characters? Can I bring my capabilities to my trapped and sheltering brethren? Can I find others who need salvation, and strike down the sinners in my path?

[20] A Wish Granted - With the power to rewrite reality there is no more creative or destructive force than that of a wish.
- Who was the giver and who received such an unfathomable gift?
    The giver was [NAME???], the owner of "Ringo" team. I received an offer to join the crew after my dedicated prayers.
- What was it they wished for? What had to change in order to make such a thing real?
    I wished to see my family again. A slot opened on the team, and I was scouted upon their return.
- Was the reality of their desire everything they wanted or did they live to regret ever asking for it?
    The crew's callous and murderous nature was at first terrifying, and even sickening. But, it showed me that I need to be harder. I need to be willing to strike down the worthless, to build my skills. They will be needed when Rapture comes.
- What happens when you get what you ask for?
    Near-death, several times, but saved by the grace of God. My debt to Him grows, but it shows that I am important. Needed. I strive everyday to be the soldier my Lord needs.

## SCRAPPER BACKGROUND QUESTIONS

What happened to them to end up here? What mistakes did they make? Who did they upset?
- She was captured as a late teen by WY security forces when they rounded up her ship upon return to the planet. Her first mistake was being born into the group and sticking with them until it all fell apart. The second was trying to sneak back on-world after the calamity hit the planet.

Where is your character from? Are they Weyland-Yutani? American? Space Drifter?
- Space pirates, "refugees" from UPP expansion (aka criminals and diehard religious capitalists, sovcit zealots).

How many doses of Ether, if any, has your character taken before? Choose any number from 0-2
- Once. She viewed the experience as His guiding hand pushing her forward to victory. She felt so lost, for all her power, but He taught her how to wield it. She has been reborn as a perfect crusader.

Your character might be one or two of these roles at the same time. Many crews have overlap between them.

Which of your characters, if any, would you be okay with being a secret android?  Keep in mind there may be 0 secret androids in this game just as much as there being one.
Not Zeal-Of-The-Land Kazato.

Finally, would you be okay with your character being a mole who is giving away info to outsiders? (provided that they are a member of the Calamity Jane)?
YES, but I'd prefer to be on the Ringo team.
