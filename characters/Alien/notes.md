## Session 3 - 2024-03-19
- Arrive at big door
    - Determine there's some diagonal seam in the lower-right third of the door
    - Bedelia "cooks" her way into the control panel access, opens the exterior door, which depressurizes somewhat
    - Ellaria leaves the ship parked outside
- Inside the entrance chamber
    - Decorated like a mythologized 1860s wild west set
    - 60ft cube with vaulted ceiling
    - Along right wall is a control console and a pair of bodies in vacc suits
- We examine the bodies
    - Body 1 is un-decayed
        - Determined by autopsy (via Barber) to be a (female?) android
            - Bullet wound to collar bone
            - Bullet wound to right elbow
            - Ring and pinkie finger on left hand bitten off
            - Rib cage to pelvis torn open by teeth
            - Bullet retrieved from left clavicle, smith and wesson revolver round typical of guns distributed to tourists
            - Whatever bit into the abdominal cavity kept biting into the android's organs
            - Barber can't tell the relative ages of the wounds
    - Body 2 is partially decayed, as expected of a person in a sealed suit
        - Sabrina opens up the suit, inside is a human
            - Was wearing a dress, which is now expectedly grody
            - Heavy gouges on thighs and calf, assumed teeth or very large claws
            - Looks like the person was not poisoned or diseased in any obvious way (and no vomit on dress)
            - Person appears to have died of dehydration/starvation, as they are emaciated and wounds are scabbed over
- We interact with the console
    - On the floor is a silver keycard, which when inserted in the console, began some "VIP Experience", outer door closes and inner door button (on wallpaper sheriff's badge) lights up green, clearly pressable to enter
    - Retrying the console opens a command prompt, attempting to request exit returns a negative response, only a weyland yutani admin can authorize an emergency exit
    - Bedelia has the hacker fight of her life, as she successfully cuts the room's console from the control of whatever system was operating against her
        - The doors are now freely accessible from the console inside this room, outside the building, and the assumed sister console on the inside of the interior door
        - The system can still only open one of the doors at a time
