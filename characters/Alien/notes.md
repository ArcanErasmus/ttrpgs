    - Deep scratches in the interior of the door we entered through
    - The interior is filled with the same dust as outside, which was kicked up by the door opening
    - Air vents are hidden in the walls, very thin vent slats made to blend in with wall
    - Notables: Teller desk, open hallway, open door, closed "staff only" door, no power to terminal

    - Weird area with tiny holes machined into wall, a gap behind, then some reflective surface
        - Sabrina's guess: speakers, filter, decontamination system?
    - It's strange that this place is both fully underground, and has vacc suit storage at the entrance. Wasn't the atmosphere habitable during this place's usage?
        - Perhaps this was used as a safehouse after the calamity started?
    - Investigator: What happened here?
        - People left vacc suits, and people took vacc suits in a hurry

        - There are a pair of bullet holes in the underside of a locker, that ricocheted off the floor at a shallow angle
            - Perhaps they shot at something here? But they didn't have a gun, perhaps they were shot at?

            - Surface level bite/claw marks to chest

            - Gun in left hand
        - No trail of blood, but splatters on clothes, likely injured in this location? Likely hiding, and failed?
    - The gun is a western replica revolver, S&W something or other, similar to the .357
        - Has one bullet chambered, 5 empties, last round is jammed
        - Barrel/chamber is scratched irregularly, was chewed on?

        - Body is heavily bitten, but not eaten, except for the leg (leg is ambiguous)
        - Barber punches in the chest cavity inexplicably, for emphasis
        - Pockets:
            - VIP card
            - Blood soaked cash
            - Military ID card of "Sam Adleson", brigadier general of the United Americas coast guard (space force), issued 11/2297, expired 2302
    - We discover that the ID card was issued 6 mo after the climate calamity came to a head
        - This person arrived long after the calamity started
            - Ether use... military applications, recovery of Ether supplies?
            - VIP rescue operation gone wrong?
        - But why were they wearing costume clothes?
            - Computer demanded it?
            - Here so long they needed a full change of outfit, boots included?
            - Some sort of undercover operation, pretending to be a guest?
    - Barber checks the vent in the costume room
        - It pries open
        - Inside the vent are a pair of flexible woven metal hockey pucks, which are very magnetic, Barber pulls one out
        - Underneath it is a porthole that goes down far
        - Taking a picture of the pipe shows it's grungy on the inside, silver dust, black smudges, mold spores
        - Vent looks like it has a latch that can be opened through a terminal, some electric thing

## Session 3 - 2024-03-19
- Arrive at big door
    - Determine there's some diagonal seam in the lower-right third of the door
    - Bedelia "cooks" her way into the control panel access, opens the exterior door, which depressurizes somewhat
    - Ellaria leaves the ship parked outside
- Inside the entrance chamber
    - Decorated like a mythologized 1860s wild west set
    - 60ft cube with vaulted ceiling
    - Along right wall is a control console and a pair of bodies in vacc suits
- We examine the bodies
    - Body 1 is un-decayed
        - Determined by autopsy (via Barber) to be a (female?) android
            - Bullet wound to collar bone
            - Bullet wound to right elbow
            - Ring and pinkie finger on left hand bitten off
            - Rib cage to pelvis torn open by teeth
            - Bullet retrieved from left clavicle, smith and wesson revolver round typical of guns distributed to tourists
            - Whatever bit into the abdominal cavity kept biting into the android's organs
            - Barber can't tell the relative ages of the wounds
    - Body 2 is partially decayed, as expected of a person in a sealed suit
        - Sabrina opens up the suit, inside is a human
            - Was wearing a dress, which is now expectedly grody
            - Heavy gouges on thighs and calf, assumed teeth or very large claws
            - Looks like the person was not poisoned or diseased in any obvious way (and no vomit on dress)
            - Person appears to have died of dehydration/starvation, as they are emaciated and wounds are scabbed over
- We interact with the console
    - On the floor is a silver keycard, which when inserted in the console, began some "VIP Experience", outer door closes and inner door button (on wallpaper sheriff's badge) lights up green, clearly pressable to enter
    - Retrying the console opens a command prompt, attempting to request exit returns a negative response, only a weyland yutani admin can authorize an emergency exit
    - Bedelia has the hacker fight of her life, as she successfully cuts the room's console from the control of whatever system was operating against her
        - The doors are now freely accessible from the console inside this room, outside the building, and the assumed sister console on the inside of the interior door
        - The system can still only open one of the doors at a time
