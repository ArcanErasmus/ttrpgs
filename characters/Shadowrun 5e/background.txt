bg fic
open on courier services, she's just dropped off a package at a location, gets a message from her job asking her to come back
returns to pick up the next delivery, called into the office, expecting to get a talking to for something she's forgotten about
instead, they mention that they received a tipoff from a client about a potential administrative issue
her SIN has a discrepancy, one of the licenses doesn't fully match up
she thinks back to the nice hotel earlier in the evening, the door scanners
she thinks back to the scowling human at the front desk who seemed skeptical that she had legitimate business, or perhaps they were unhappy with what the scanners registered
her heart drops as she realizes there's no going back to this SIN, or this job
her boss looks at her with the kind of pity shown by someone who's never suffered in their life, but thinks themselves a friend to the downtrodden
as if its a *favor* that she won't call the cops, she'll give her time to appeal it, but she can't come back to work until she does
of course, it's not her real SIN, that doesn't exist anymore. any appeal would only invite deeper scrutiny

ironic, how she fought to choose her name, even got the paperwork to stick. Anya Ulan, a little joke to herself. the only consolation prize was that the deletion took any connection to her birth name with it.
thoughts swim of her best fake SIN. everything is connected to it, she can't afford to risk it, not like this job would accept it anyway
realizing that she's still wearing the backpack, that nobody stopped her from taking it. not that it's worth that much, it's durable but still a one-size-fits-all make.
she stands there behind the dumpster, cutting the threads that hold the company's logo on (insert description of logo)
she cuts the security tag off her gun in the alleyway, leaving it in the dumpster. it will send out a ping, but she'll be long gone
halfway home it hits her that she can't even get in. she'd been too focused on job prospects, on the nauseating cost of a new fake SIN, that it slipped her mind.
feeling like a woman with nothing to lose, she locks her bike to the fire escape and climbs up it, stopping outside the bathroom window.
she always felt like someone could walk up and stare in the window, as if that sheet of glass was a vulnerability that no amount of metal bars could hide. if someone saw her, would they think her a freak for her digitigrade legs? she snorts. 'at least the bigots are mostly focused on that nowadays, rather than other aspects of her body'
her gaze drifts down from the high window to the wall underneath it. for all that the reinforcing and breakage sensors make it secure, it wasn't how she would get in. the naked chrome that ran from her hip joints down to her hooftips had a few very big advantages over the fur and flesh it replaced. ones she had spent a premium on, back when her bank account had more zeros than she could wrap her head around. the kind of money that, if she had even a hundredth of today, would let her live in relative comfort for years if she could stretch it. if she had a job like the one she just left.
these circling thoughts weren't going anywhere, and it was time to move before the neighbors got suspicious of someone hanging around on the fire escape. anya pulled off her left boot and raised the leg, the synthetic musculature sliding silently into a practiced pose, and lashed out with her full strength. her hardened hoof crashed through the brick, kicking up a cloud of dust. her optical sensors cut through the obscuring particles, and with two more kicks, she had cleared enough of an opening to crawl through.
she brushes herself off and steps out into the hallway, coming face to face with her roommate, [name]. roommate expresses shock, fear, compassion. she always was nice like that, having dealt with her own fare share of street life. "my SIN. it's burned" is all anya has to say. she's explained her past to roommate, who knows what this means now. "let me help you pack, [other roommie] will be home soon and you don't want her to see this"
anya stuffs her backpack with essentials, and as she turns to leave, roommate shoves a plushie in her hands. she's holding the little satyr plushie of her own, but not saying anything. abruptly, anya realizes that she's trying not to cry. anya is too, and can only mouth a goodbye before bolting out the door. anya doesn't want to thinka bout the look in roommate's eyes, consoling herself that if she had realized what it meant earlier, if they'd... been something, it would have hurt even more. it wouldn't have done any good to exchange numbers on her burner, not with the scrutiny that roommate will be under in the near future just for associating with anya.
she pedals away at speed, and the sirens sound like (sobbing?)
cut to a couple weeks later
she flicks on her tshirt, her lifeline. in AR, the world lights up with beautiful art, and an overwhelming amount of advertising, but her shirt is still plain, as if it wasn't enabled. flipping it around she finds an address and a time, and her mood spikes. finally. she almost can't believe this makeshift solution works, a way to avoid using even a burner commlink for someone who is laying low, AR clothing attracts even less suspicion, especially if it's not tied to a fashion subscription. after writing it down on plain paper, she hard resets it and starts collecting her meagre belongings. this was going to clear out most of her remaining creds, but at least it would let her walk the streets without risking arrest.
maybe i can play up the cost more. she just got this new SIN, connects herself to it, but now she has to get some money fast.
consider tying this in to the gym, and her contact diana phan.
figure out where she got the tip or the idea to hit a cutter place.
consider her thieving skills, she's robbed stuff to pay her contact, who will clean the tags off things for her.
