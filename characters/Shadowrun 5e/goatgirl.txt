  - [ ] Do you have ammo for your gun(s), both regular and gel rounds (nonlethal)?

  - [ ] Do you have fake licenses on at least one of your fake SINs for every type of restricted gear or skill you have? (Decking license, magic license, firearm license, concealed carry license, driver's license, fishing license...)

  - [X] Do you have nothing of availability higher than 12? (Alphaware adds to the availability rating; don't be blindsided by your cybertorso becoming too hot an item when you try to make it less essence-costly)
