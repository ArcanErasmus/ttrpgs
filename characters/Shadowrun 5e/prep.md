# things i need to do for tonight:
## GM Help
### Combat
#### Basics
##### Combat turn sequence
- *Combat Turn* = 3 second chunk, 20 = 1 min
- Combat Turns broken up into *Initiative Passes*
- Initiative Passes broken into *Action Phases*
- ("My Turn" = "My Action Phase")
1. Roll Initiative
    - note that wound modifiers affect this immediately!
2. Begin Iniative Pass
    - go through everyone's Action Phases in initiative order
    - GM is allowed to say everything happens simultaneously
3. Begin Action Phase
    - If a character delayed, they declare now whether they are going before, during, or after the current character
3a. Declare all actions
    - 2 *Simple Actions* OR 1 *Complex Action*
    - 1 *Free Action*
    - If someone who has already acted has an unused Free Action, they can declare it here
3b. Resolve all actions
4. Do the rest of the Action Phases
    - Once everyone has acted in the Initiative Pass, subtract 10 from each initiative, and if anyone has positive initiative left, do another Initiative Pass for them
5. Go to step 1, rolling again for initiative
**Takeaways**
- Initiative immediately decreased by taking wounds
- Can still take free action if 0 or less initiative
##### Initiative
- Initiative Score
    - Can raise with Edge, maximum total 5d6 rolled
    - If ties, compare ERIC attributes (Edge, Reaction, Intuition, Coin-toss)
    - Chars with 0 or less initiative can take one free action
- Changing Initiative
    - If gain or lose score or dice, immediately alter initiative score
    - If enter combat after it's already begun, roll as normal and then modify for initiative passes that have already happened (e.g. -10 if on second pass)
- Initiative and Edge
    - Can spend to do the following:
    - Sieze the Initiative: Move to the top of the order, regardless of score
        - If multiple chars do this, resolve ties by score and ERIC
        - Change in order lasts through all Passes in the Combat Turn
    - Blitz: Roll the maximum of 5d6 for initiative for a single Combat Turn
- Delaying
    - Declare on step 3a when you would declare actions
    - Can delay until a later Initiative Pass, but don't get a second Phase that Pass
    - If multiple chars delay to the same point, break ties with ERIC
    - Any actions taken by the delaying character take a -1 die pool penalty
- Timed Items
    - Timed items go based on preset intervals or are set by user
    - This can be based on beginning/end of a Combat Turn, or a certain Action Phase in a certain Initiative pass
    - Timed items always go last in ties
**Takeaways**
- If delay, can choose to go before/during/after at a later phase
- Delaying gives you a -1 penalty
- Can hold free actions for later phases
##### Movement
- Three Types: *Walking*, *Running*, *Sprinting*
- Move rate is for total of all Initiative Passes, based on Run
- Standard Movement (Walk & Run)
    - Characters considered Running once they go above their Walk rate in a Combat Turn
    - Characters considered Running consume their Free Action each Initiative Pass
- Sprinting
    - Can make a Sprint Action during Action Phase to increase move rate
    - Allowed to make Sprint tests up to half Running skill per Combat Turn, min 1
    - See *Fatigue from Running pp172*
- Running modifiers
    - If running, -2 dice pool modifier to all actions except Sprinting
    - Running into melee gives +4 dice (net +2)
    - -2 dice to hit a Running opponent with ranged attack, -4 vs Sprinting
- Action Phase
    - Once a character declares movement during their action phase, can change dist or decrease based on new info, but can't increase
    - See *pp162/163 for common actions*
**Takeaways**
- Once you start Running, can't use free actions (can't Free and then Run in same phase either)
- Must declare movement, can decrease/change direction but can't increase
##### Matrix Actions
- see Matrix pp214, but *matrix actions chart pp164*
##### Free Actions
- Can take at any point in Pass if not surprised, otherwise only after your Phase
- GM can allow multiple if easily combined (e.g. drop item and speak phrase)
- Usually require no Test
- Free Actions
    - *Call a Shot pp178*
    - Change mode of linked device
        - For direct wired/wireless link
    - Drop held object(s)
        - Might damage stuff
    - Drop prone/kneel if not surprised
    - Eject smartgun clip
    - Gesture
        - Chars unfamiliar with gesture can make Intuition (2) test
    - Declare multiple attack targets in a single action
        - *Multiple attacks pp196*
    - Speak/text/transmit phrase
    - Run
        - Can't use to move outside phase, just that running consumes your free action
**Takeaways**
- dropping things can break them
##### Simple Actions
- Only one Simple action can be an attack in a single Phase
- Actions
    - Activate focus
    - Change mode of device/gun
        - For simple button/switch, physical or virtual
        - See *firearms pp424*, *smartguns pp433*, *shotguns pp429*
    - Call/command/dismiss spirit
    - Fire SA/SS/BF/FA, fire bow, or throw weapon
        - See *multiple attacks pp96*, *off-hand pp178*
    - Insert OR Remove clip
        - Usually must do both sequentially, see *reloading chart pp163*
    - Observe in detail
        - Allows *Perception test pp135*
        - Can't tell who someone is without either relying on basic colors or using this action
    - Pick up/put down object within reach
    - Quick draw
        - Weapon skill + reaction (3) test
        - Lets you draw and fire in a single action
        - Can do two weapons at once, but split die pool and apply off-hand penalty
    - Draw/Ready weapon
        - Might take Complex if not in a traditional holster
        - Can ready half-agility number of small throwing weapons in one action
    - Reckless Spellcasting
        - see *cast spell 281*
    - Shift perception (astral)
    - Stand up
        - Body + willpower (2) if wounded, apply wound penalties
    - Take aim
        - cumulative benefits, but lost if do anything else (incl free action) before attacking
        - max bonus to either limit or die pool is half willpower rounded up
        - +1 to die pool OR to accuracy per action
        - if using image magnification or targeting scope, must take aim to enable said device (don't get usual +1 from the action on top)
    - Take cover if not *surprised pp192*
    - Use Simple device
        - thumb trigger, single keypress, single icon tap, etc
**Takeaways**
- Reloading is basically always a Complex action (or 2 Simples)
- Quick draw critical glitches are hilarious
- Observation is VERY limited unless you use Observe In Detail action. for example, if you bust through a door, you might note that there are "a few people" in a room, but not who, what they are wearing, what they are holding, etc, unless you actually take the simple action to look at a single person (or look for something that stands out)
##### Complex Actions
- Actions
    - Astral projection
    - Banish spirit
    - Cast spell
    - Fire FA weapon, or SA burst, or long burst
    - Load and fire bow
    - Fire mounted/vehicle weapon
    - Matrix actions
    - *Melee attack pp184*
    - Reload firearm
    - Rigger jump in
    - Sprint
    - Summoning
    - Use *skill pp128*
**Takeaways**
- Melee is complex
- Sprinting is complex
- Most skill usages are complex
##### Interrupt Actions
- Can only take if you have enough initiative score left to pay for it
- Can only take before first action phase if not surprised
- *defending in combat pp188*
- Actions
    - Block -5, add Unarmed Combat skill to melee defense test
    - Dodge -5, add Gymnastics skill to melee defense test
    - Parry -5, add {Melee Weapon} skill to melee defense test
        - Incorporates weapon-specific bonus dice
    - Hit the dirt -5
        - Avoid suppressive fire, don't make Reaction + Edge test
        - Drop prone if already used Free Action
    - Intercept -5
        - basically an opportunity attack, see *interception pp194*
        - if opponent is within 1 + Reach meters, melee attack out of turn
    - Full defense -10
        - Adds willpower to defense tests for entire Combat Turn
        - Can pre-emptively take this action
        - Cumulative with other defense actions
**Takeaways**
- Intercept = oppy, reach matters for it
- Can take Full Defense in advance if you are worried you might lose initiative later
##### Accuracy
- Weapons have an Accuracy score, this is a Limit for them
- Unarmed attacks and items used as part of them just use Physical limit
- Poor condition or busted weapons usually get -1 accuracy, incl if damaged by matrix combat
**Takeaways**
- Melee: 3 for junk, 4 for improvised, 5 for weapons
- Ranged: 3 for improvised, 4/5 for typical, 6 for high accuracy
##### Armor
- see *defend pp173*, and *armor penetration pp169*
- if modified DV is less than AP-modified armor rating, attack does stun damage instead of phys
- Armor and encumbrance
    - Use highest armor value, don't stack unless they have a +
    - Max bonus from stacking is limited to Strength attr
    - Exceeding max stacking bonus gives -1 to Agi and Reac per 2 full points over
- Specialized protection
    - Armor doesn't help with electricity/fire/other unless you spec it for that
- Armor penetration
    - positive AP doesn't apply if target is unarmored
    - negative AP can't reduce armor below 0
**Takeaways**
- Watch your Str vs bonus armor, can go over by 1 w/ no penalty
- Never have no armor or +AP weapons will shred you
##### Damage
- Physical damage
    - P damage, most proper weapons do this
- Stun damage
    - S damage, comes from basic unarmed, or stun weapons
    - Bruising, muscle fatigue, etc
- Wound modifiers
    - Every third damage box stacks a penalty
    - Applies to every single test that's not about reducing incoming damage
        - Damage Resistance, resisting direct combat spells, resisting toxins, etc
- Exceeding the condition monitor
    - Stun damage rolls over into physical track, 1 point for every 2 full extra stun damage
    - Physical damage overflows up to Body attr, going over this is instant death
    - If no medical attention, take one physical box of damage for every Body rating minutes
**Takeaways**
- Low body = fast death, possibly in one hit
##### Elemental Damage
- GM can affect damage ratings based on reasonable factors
- Acid damage
    - Physical
    - Also reduces rating of any armor it hits by 1
    - If not washed off, base DV decreased by 1 and re-applied every Combat Turn, also reducing armor again
    - Armor reduction should go to worn gear first, could go to +armor accessories if GM allows
    - At GM discretion, can create Light Smoke in the area
- Cold damage
    - Physical
    - If any armor hit, make a simple Armor Test, if no hits, breaks and can't be used as armor, on glitch destroyed irreparably, on crit glitch same also destroyed dangerously somehow
- Electricity damage
    - Stun or Physical based on source
    - Chars injured by electricity take -1 die penalty on everything except damage resistance tests for 1 turn, and immediately lose 5 initiative score
        - Penalties don't stack, but duration does
        - If go below 0 initiative, negative rolls over to next Combat Turn
    - Drones/devices always take Physical from electricity
        - If they take any elec damage, they take secondary Matrix damage equal to half Physical rounded down
        - Vehicles don't take this secondary effect, but their specific systems can if targeted by called shots
- Fire damage
    - Physical
    - Roll armor value + fire resistance - fire AP, threshold net hits on fire-based attack, to determine if something resists catching on fire
    - If something catches fire, initial DV of 3, takes damage at start of each Combat Turn, each subsequent turn this goes up by 1 until destroyed or put out
    - Can fight fire with agility + intuition test, hits reduce fire's DV, requires some way to smother or douse it
    - Fire AP: open flame -2, flame-based weapon -6, fire spell -Force
- Falling damage
    - if fall >3m, take Physical damage with DV of distance, AP -4, resist with body + armor
    - GM can modify damage for landing surfaces
- Fatigue damage
    - Stun damage, from strenuous actions or harsh environs
    - Resisted with body + willpower, not armor
    - Can't be healed until source is dealt with
    - Running: Each consecutive sprint does cumulative 1S DV fatigue damage, starts with the second, if only running take every 3 minutes
        - "Consecutive" means consecutive Combat Turns, or during multiple Action Phases in the same Combat Turn
    - Environments: starts with 1S and increases over time, see *environment & fatigue pp172*
    - Hunger/thirst/tiredness: after 24 hrs, 1S and increases by interval, hunger 6 days, thirst 2 days, sleep 3hrs
**Takeaways**
- Carry a water bottle or maybe cat litter or sand to deal with acid
- Be able to put out a fire on yourself or a friend
- Elemental damage will fuck up your armor
- Falling damage is blocked by armor
##### Combat Resolution
- *Ranged combat pp173*, *melee combat pp184*, *astral combat pp315*, *cybercombat pp226*
- Always an opposed test, defender wins ties
    - Exception: tie means attacker scored a grazing hit, which matters for contact-based stuff (shock gloves, poisons, some spells, etc)
- DADA: Declare, Attack, Defend, Apply effect
1. Declare
    - Attacker declares during action phase, defender declares defense method
2. Attacker rolls attack
3a. Defender rolls defense
3. If attacker got more hits, add net hits to weapon DV, and apply AP to defender's armor value
    - If modified DV >= modified Armor, Physical, otherwise Stun
    - Defender rolls to resist damage
4. Apply remaining damage to condition monitor, consider wound modifiers, and check for *knockdown pp194*
**Takeaways**
- Armor is an incredible way to turn physical damage into stun damage
- You declare defense type when attacker declares attack, and consider you might not even know what they are attacking with if you haven't had the time to take a close look
#### Ranged Combat
- Net hits can be used to reduce scatter for thrown/launched weapons
- Ranged attack modifiers: environmental, recoil, situational, wound
##### Environmental Modifiers
- Use only most severe penalty, or increase by one category if multiple are tied for worst, range is included in this
- See charts *environmental modifiers and compensation pp175*
- Recoil
    - If you are firing two guns at once, recoil stacks together
    - Recoil compensation modifier: 1 + Str/3 (round up) + gun recoil comp
    - Subtract num bullets about to be fired, if the result is negative, apply that penalty to your dice pool for the attack
    - If making multiple firearm attacks in a single phase, figure out total penalty for the phase and apply it before splitting the pool up for attacks
- Progressive recoil
    - Recoil accumulates from every shot across multiple action phases and combat turns unless the character takes (or is forced to take) any other simple/complex actions than shooting
- Single shot weapons do not accumulate recoil
- Mounted weapons have bonus recoil compensation equal to the Body of the vehicle/drone
##### Situational Modifiers
- See *situational modifiers pp176*
##### Firearms
- Can do Multiple Attacks free action if you are holding multiple weapons or firing multiple projectiles in one attack
- *Firing Modes pp179*
- Suppressive fire
    - Complex action, 20 rounds, icnores recoil
    - Target a triangular area up to max range, width 10m at end and height 2m
    - Zone lasts until end of combat turn unless the firer moves or commits to another action
    - Make weapon skill + agi [acc] test including bonuses for weapon modifiers, record hits
    - Anyone in the area who isn't in cover or prone must make a reaction + edge test (plus any full defense bonuses) with threshold of attacker's hits
    - Anyone hit takes weapon's base DV (plus ammo)
- Not Enough Bullets
    - If short on ammo, reduce defense modifiers from the attack by 1 per bullet missing
    - Suppressive fire reduces width by 1m per 2 full bullets missing
- Shotguns
    - Use slugs by default, can use flechette ammo rules instead if loading shot rounds and can set choke
    - See *choke settings pp180-181*
**Takeaways**
- Suppression is powerful
##### Projectiles
- Throwing Weapons
    - Shuriken/throwing knives can be readied in batches of Agi/2 per Ready Weapon action
- Grenades
    - Choose a location as a target, roll Throwing Weapons + Agi [Physical] (3) to land it where you want
        - If don't meet threshold, see *scatter table pp182*
    - Built-in timer
        - Detonates on next Combat Turn on the thrower's current initiative score -10
    - Motion sensor
        - Detonates immediately on hitting target on a success
        - On failed attack roll, roll scatter and then it explodes, roll double scatter on glitch and then explode
        - Crit glitch sets off grenade in thrower's hand
    - Wireless link
        - Can be set off by thrower or anyone with a mark on it, requires attacker to have DNI and use Change Wireless Device Mode free action
        - Without DNI, must use Change Linked Device Mode simple action and receive full scatter
- Grenade Launchers, Rockets, Missiles
    - Same as throwing a grenade, but use Heavy Weapons instead of Throwing Weapons, and [Accuracy] instead of [Physical]
    - Launchers have a min range of 5, unless this safety feature is disarmed with an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (4, 10 minutes) Extended Test
- Determine Scatter
    - Direction based on 2d6 roll, distance based on type of munition, see *scatter diagram pp182*
- Blast Effects
    - See *grenades/rockets/missiles table pp435* for damage numbers and falloff
- Blasts in a confined space
    - See *destroying barriers pp197* rules
    - If the barriers hold up the blast is channeled and a shockwave rebounds, and can hit characters a second time or even more
        - Sum the DV from the initial and all shockwaves for the attack
    - It's possible, in a small sturdy room, to bounce an explosion off all six surfaces and do several times the grenade's base damage
- Multiple simultaneous blasts
    - Add half the lower DVs to the highest DV, use the best AP+1, then apply it as a single hit
**Takeaways**
- Cook those timers, this will always go well
- Motion sensors are great if you don't fuck up
- Wireless requires a LOT of trust
- Sturdy rooms make grenades extra lethal
##### Bows/Crossbows/Gunnery
- -3 dice per point below minimum Str
- Base damage calc from lower of bow and arrow rating
- Modern crossbows have autoloaders and hold 4 bolts
- Vehicle mounted weapons use Gunnery + Agility [Accuracy] for manual operation, like door guns on mounts, or Gunnery + Logic [Accuracy] for remote operated systems
    - Always a Complex action
- -2 dice for firing a handheld weapon from a moving vehicle
- Drone gunnery uses Piloting + {Weapon} Targeting *autosoft rating pp269* [Accuracy], drones cannot fire without a correct autosoft
**Takeaways**
- idk it makes sense
##### Sensor Attacks
- To detect something using sensors, roll opposed, see *sensor attacks and defense pp184*
- Sensor targeting can help with Gunnery 
    - Passive targeting, sub Sensor for Accuracy, use Gunnery + Logic [Sensor], *target signature pp184* applies
    - Active targeting, first make Sensor Test as a simple action to lock on
        - Net hits applied as defense negative, failure means no active targeting attack can be made
        - Target lock remains until broken, such as with Evade Detection
**Takeaways**
- nerds lock on, jocks lock in
#### Melee Combat
- Situational modifiers that affect both combatants equally can often be ignored to save on calculations
##### Melee Modifiers
- If one combatant has a reach advantage, the difference is applied to the defender's dice pool
- If running towards an opponent, +2 instead of -2 to the attack
- See *modifiers table pp187*
##### Multiple Attackers
- Simple: +1 die bonus for having at least one allied attacker engaged in same melee
- Complex: Can roll to aid allies as a Complex action, Combat Skill + Agility [Accuracy] vs target's Intuition
    - Net hits added as dice pool bonus to next ally that attacks this target
    - Next ally can use these as a bonus to their own aid roll instead, up to three teamwork rolls can be made before a regular attack must happen
**Takeaway**
- Multiple attackers good but not worth aiding if both have reasonable odds on their own
#### Defending in Combat
- Can only dodge/block/parry in melee not ranged
- See *defense modifiers pp189*
- Not listed but the -2 to shoot a running target becomes -4 vs a sprinting target
**Takeaway**
- Being shot is scary
#### Special Actions
##### Surprise
- Surprise Tests, roll Reaction + Intuition (3)
    - Characters alerted in some way get +3 dice
    - no Limit, just success means act normally
    - Failure means characters lose 10 from their Initiative Score
        - Can surprise someone mid-combat, still lose 10 initiative
    - Glitch is failure but also startles character in some way, possibly dropping/knocking into something
    - Crit glitch stuns character basically, skip first Action phase entirely, then enter combat at -20 initiative (-10 surprise + -10 entering combat late)
- Ambushing
    - If ambushing, never surprised by targets if aware of movement/actions of target
    - Characters who lie in wait still receive +6 dice to surprise tests if unaware of exactly what target is up to
- Surprise in combat
    - Whenever characters are unexpectedly introduced to a combat situation, the GM should call for a surprise test for ALL characters, and adjust initiative appropriately
- Effects of surprise
    - Surprised characters cannot take any actions that directly affect/impede/counteract characters who are not surprised
    - This includes friendly actions
**Takeaways**
- Mid-combat surprise sounds complicated and fun
##### Interception
- If character moves by another and attempts to pass by without attacking, or tries to disengage from melee, can intercept
- If character attempting to pass by takes damage equal or greater than their Body (after Resistance test), they cannot continue their movement
- Can take Complex action to test Agility + Gymnastics [Physical] (1), hits above threshold = num opponents they can avoid
- Can't intercept while prone
**Takeaways**
- Avoiding interception is unopposed, so get good at Gymnastics
##### Knockdown
- If a character takes damage (either type) after Resistance test greater than physical limit, they automatically fall prone (see Drop Prone action)
    - Also happens if they take 10+ damage regardless of phys limit
- Some weapons reduce physical limit for this calculation
- Can also try to knock down in melee with called shots
##### Subduing
- Start with unarmed combat as normal, if attacker hits, compare attacker Strength + net hits to defender's physical limit
    - If attacker succeeds, they grapple and immobilize the defender, does not cause damage
    - Defender can't do any actions that require physical movement
- To break a lock, complex action unarmed combat test threshold equal to attacker's net hits
- Attacker doesn't have to roll but must spend a Complex action to maintain position, and gets to do one of the following:
    - make unarmed combat attack to get a better grip, attacker gets +2 superior position modifier, net hits are added/subtracted from the original number
    - inflict stun damage DV of Strength, no test but Resisted as normal
    - knock defender down using called shot rules, attacker gets +2 superior position modifier
**Takeaways**
- Grappling is pretty simple actually
##### Called Shots
- -4 dice penalty and cost a free action in addition to basic attack action
- *Called shots pp195*
    - Blast out of hands
        - item sent flying net hits -1 m from defender, in direction away from shooter
    - Dirty trick
        - if even 1 net hit, opponent takes -4 dice to their next action from distraction
    - Harder knock
        - do P with S attack
    - Knock down (melee only)
        - see Knockdown, does no damage, attacker falls with defender on glitch, 
    - Shake up
        - defender loses 5 initiative and takes normal damage
    - Splitting the damage
        - split damage between P and S, Stun takes the odd point
        - can only do when attacker AP < defender Armor
        - if modified total DV is less than modified Armor, only do the stun half of the damage
    - Trick shot
        - need setup to look cool
        - num hits are bonus to dice of intimidation test made by attacker or known ally afterwards
    - Vitals
        - +2 DV
**Takeaways**
- these aren't just for the meme
##### Multiple Attacks
- Split dice evenly between attacks and handle separately
- Dice from edge applied before pool is split, but can reroll all with a single Edge
- Can make at most attacks numbering one-half attacker's Combat Skill in a single Action Phase
##### Dead Man's Trigger
- When a char would die or fall unconscious, they can get a final action if:
    - They have at least 1 initiative
    - They spend 1 Edge, which has no other bonuses
    - They succeed on a Body + Willpower (3) test after spending the Edge
#### Barriers
- Structure and Armor are analogous to Body and Armor
- Condition Monitor for every region of 1m x 1m x 10cm, boxes equal to Structure rating
- See *barrier ratings pp197* for structure and armor of common materials
##### Shooting Through Barriers
- Defender using the barrier as cover receives defense bonus for cover
- If defender completely hidden, -6 blind fire penalty to attacker, but defender unaware
- If barrier takes hit first, roll Structure+Armor to resist damage, takes unresisted damage
    - Any damage past the Structure rating continues on through the barrier
    - If weapon's modified DV does not exceed barrier's Armor, attack automatically fails
##### Destroying Barriers
- If trying to destroy the barrier, roll same as above
    - Attack is unresisted, so hits on the attack roll is just to generate extra DV
    - Roll damage anyway on no hits unless critical glitch
- Unresisted damage creates holes in barrier, 1 sq meter per multiple of the Structure rating
- See *damaging barriers pp198* for damage multipliers vs barriers
##### Penetration Weapons
- If you are using a primarily penetrating weapon, GM's call, the barrier takes 1 point (or maybe 0 points) of damage and the rest continues through
    - Ex: Bullets, stabbing with a pointed blade
    - Firing multiple rounds increases damage absorbed/taken by barrier: 2 for 3 bullets, 3 for 6 bullets, 4 for 10
    - Reminder: if the attack's DV is not equal to or greater than the Armor, it is stopped dead, no damage taken, none goes through
##### Body Barriers
- If using a body to block, use Body for Structure, Armor = Armor
- Bodies are awkward to use as a shield, take AGI and REA penalty equal to difference between holder's STR and body's BODY
**Takeaways**
- You can kick down concrete if you're borged up enough
- Shooting through barriers is easier than shooting them apart
- Automatic fire is more effective at breaking things but still sucks
- Hell yeah there are rules for meatshields
#### Vehicles
`TODO`
#### Healing
##### First Aid
- Needs medkit (even if it's out of supplies), only within 1hr of taking the damage
- Roll First Aid + Logic [Mental] (2), see *healing modifiers pp208*
    - Net hits remove boxes of damage, divide in half if target is wearing full-body armor
    - Crit glitch increases that type of damage by 1d3 instead
    - Max healable damage equals First Aid skill rating
- Can only apply First Aid once per set of wounds, can't do if character has been magically healed
    - Can do Heal spell after First Aid however
- In combat, Complex Action and takes number of Combat Turns equal to number of boxes of damage being healed
    - Healing character must spend the Complex Action every Turn, can use other Passes to do other things
- Can also roll First Aid to diagnose someone or check their condition
##### Natural Recovery
- Can bolster with medkits or autodoc drones
- Healing naturally is an Extended Test, record hits for each roll separately in case healing is interrupted
    - Stun: BOD + WIL (1 hr) Extended Test, hits = boxes of Stun damage healed
    - Phys: BOD + BOD (1 day) Extended Test, hits = boxes of Phys damage healed
    - Must rest entire time period, forced unconsciousness counts
- Stun damage heals first, then Physical damage, sequentially
- Glitch doubles the time for that healing increment
    - Crit glitch doubles as above and also increases that type of damage by 1d3
##### Medicine
- To speed up healing, roll Medicine + LOG [Mental], see healing modifiers as above, net hits give +dice to petient's next healing roll
    - Treatment takes 10m per hour for Stun, 30m per day for Physical
- Can diagnose or check condition just like First Aid
- Cannot use in combat
##### Medkits and Autodocs
- In combat, medkit/autodoc is Complex Action to apply it, then get +rating dice if wireless medkit
    - If autodoc, +dice of its First Aid or Medicine autosoft
    - If untrained in First Aid, can use LOG-1 as attr, and device's rating instead of skill
    - Wireless medkit left unattended but hooked up can roll its rating+rating [rating] on its own
##### Magical Healing
- Heal spell can heal, each hit heals one box of Physical damage, maximum of spell's Force
- Sorcery can't heal damage from magical Drain
##### Stabilization
- If not stabilized, take one box of damage every BOD minutes
- To stabilize, {First Aid or Medicine} + LOG [Mental] (3) Test, see modifiers as above
    - If failed, can keep trying at cumulative -2 per test
- Stabilize spell can stabilize, Heal spell cannot
- Must stabilize before using mundane/magical healing
**Takeaways**
- Being borged up or Awakened makes medical aid hard
- Having high initiative means you can heal people and keep shooting at the same time
- If you have the time, First Aid skill before Heal spell, then Medicine skill
- Medkits are fire and forget, don't need to be skilled, but will barely do anything
### Matrix
`TODO`
### Magic
#### Introduction
- Awakened are people who can manipulate mana
- Mana ebbs with pollution and human misery
- Types
    - Magicians- can cast spells and summon spirits
    - Adepts - can channel mana into body
- Social order
    - 2nd and 3rd gen are at the top
    - Mainstream magicians/adepts one day just awakened, lower 'class'
        - Full magicians usually feel superior to aspected
- Magical industry has built up over time, resulting in regular curio shops and alchemy stores
- Public still ignorant of magic
    - Most not as nervous as before, but still lack understanding of how it works
    - Regardless, lot of regulations for its use, licensing etc
- Magic utility
    - Adepts can surpass mundane limits, magicians create esoteric effects
    - Risk of being targeted first out of fear
- Super forbidden magic = maleficum
    - Tends to warp the brains of users
#### Magic Basics
- Magic attribute determines power
    - Can undergo *initiation pp324* to raise it
    - For every lost point (incl. partial) of Essence, reduce Magic attr and max rating by 1
        - If attr reduced to 0, can't use magic, if max rating reduced to 0, permanently burned out and now mundane
- Sorcery skills make spells - Spellcasting, Counterspelling, Ritual Casting
- Conjuring skills summon spirits - Summoning, Binding, Banishing
- Enchanting skills imbue objects with magic - Alchemy, Artificing, Disenchanting
- Force attribute measures magical power of object, being, spell, etc., used as a Limit for magic performed without reagents or foci
- Astral limit is higher of Mental or Social limit
- Magical actions can cause Drain, generally but not always inflicted as Stun damage
    - Resist with Drain Resistance test, can't be healed except by natural recovery
- Power points let adepts buy permanent powers, at chargen and later with Karma
    - Gain from raising Magic attr, or initiation
    - If you lose Magic attr points, you also lose Power Points (have to lose powers to make up the difference)
#### Traditions
- All magicians have a magical tradition, which is a way of helping them use their magic
    - Hermetic magicians called mages, shamanic magicians called shamans
    - Determines types of spirits, powers, drain resistance attributes, etc.
- Hermetic mages - see magical universe as following logical patterns
    - Tend to follow instructional texts, use formulae, symbols, fine equipment
    - Reagents often minerals, ores, chemicals, antiques
    - Often arrogant, magic based on imposing will on world
- Shamans - see magical universe as based on harmony and guidance, balancing their will with the world
    - Focus on spirits and spiritual guidance
    - Reagents often plant or animal parts, naturally purified or altered materials, handcrafted objects
    - Often develop personal connections to spirits
#### Magical Lodges
- Stationary collection of symbols, tools, writings, fetishes, and mystic materials
    - Helps spellcasters record their lore, expand their talent, practice magic
    - Not portable
- Cost and time to set up based on Force
    - Can improve with more money
