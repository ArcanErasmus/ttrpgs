        - SECCOM, being "Anthro-chauvanist", initiated "Total Biome Kill" protocols to protect the supremacy of humanity

### "Bad Guys" BG Info
- Dthal Ordo, daughter of the Achusee Ranger Commander, is a pair of fresh eyes in a world of old wounds. While headstrong at times, she’s made Ranger Captain through merit and skill alone *(if you want to decide what those skills are be my guest)*. In recent times you have crept and watched the Beggar’s works, and this new one Evergreen is curious indeed. Perhaps they have been tricked and tangled into the Beggar’s puppet strings but you know not what to make of them. Terror (`Paolo`), your father’s confidant and respected elder, watches you and listens to the thrumming of your witness. The old monster is waiting for the next song to play.
- You are here for two things. To get the mission report from Psalm (`Sophie`) who, while perhaps not the most trustworthy person, you see potential in. Be sure to ask about the lancers she encountered, as any intel on the Beggar’s Servants would be instrumental in their defeat.
- Second, it is with a heavy heart that you deliver the council’s verdict on Regret’s (`Talia`) proposed mission. He was like a wily uncle to you once, a font of wry humor and paternal strength. How the world can change in but three months, how a man can change when he loses everything he loves.
- At the arrival of professional mech pilots under the cursed union banner, the council has acceded to his demands and has approved his **“total assault”** doctrine. You didn’t even have to read the orders, all you had to do was look in his eyes to know It is to be a suicide mission. To tear out evergreen’s beating heart. You’ve made your opinions known but they were not enough to sway the verdict. 
- There is to be blood and fire, and not for all the words of wisdom inked can you stop the violence that is to come.

### "Bad Guys" Scene

### The Preparation
- The Situation Prior to Departure
    - Patience has been incapacitated, Artemis is missing (fled? kidnapped?)
    - There is no evidence of any vehicles leaving the settlement, but sensors/cameras picked up a number of subalterns exiting in a scattered group, headed 60% NNE to Mt Cooper, 10% West, and 30% SSE
    - Most encounters with the HUC occurred West of EG
- Objectives
    - Recover Artemis
        - Clue: Eros (he/they)
        - Artemis decided her destination based on messages from the orbital derelicts
        - "The poles" are also relevant
    - Clue: The bell
        - Hand-twisted metal (requiring super-human strength, most likely that of a subaltern)
        - Clear, resonant note (is the sound significant?)
        - Symbol from an old-Earth culture
        - The bell may be left for Eros, not Leto
    - Make contact with the HUC
        - Clue: Tended to attack from the west

            - Catacombs tend to avoid water-saturated areas
            - Suggests either further inland in general, or towards a raised altitude (like a mountain)
    - Learn more about The Mendicant and other SECCOM relics
        - Clue: Subalterns headed in three directions, likely to points of interest to the orbital derelicts

## Session 31
### The Journey
- Day 1: First leg - Evergreen to Mt. Cooper
    - Morning: Headed toward the mtn, passing east of Tower 2
        - Tempo spent 1 flair to use the Nelson's avoidance of difficult terrain to navigate a path
        - Encountered subalterns cannibalized for their power packs, with no tools used
        - Scans showed lots and lots of signals from around Tower 2
    - Afternoon: Hustled (double-move in one day) towards the mtn
        - Crossed rough terrain near the base
        - Panda spent 1 flair to use the Heavy Lift Gear system to help the support vehicle navigate large rocks
        - Subaltern programming had been subverted a long time ago by orbital commands, implanted weird orders to group into odd cheerleader-pyramid-like formations
    - Evening: Making camp
        - Tempo (remembered she has a bell as well, found in the ruins of the Enkidu)
            - Very similar to the double-headed bell Artemis left behind
            - Eros asked to borrow it
        - Eros (talked to Tempo about the bell)
            - "[Artemis] was listening to the ringing of the bell. Something out in the woods was saying it was going to hurt Leto's friends, and everybody. She was very scared, but went out to do it anyway. [Artemis] said she could make it stop if she went out to do something, and didn't want Leto to hurt. The thing in the woods was saying that Artemis was not being given space to grow."
            - "Artemis, or the thing that took Artemis's casket, made the bell and left it for you."
        - Castrati made dinner, some shellfish in a white wine sauce over pasta
        - Panda uprooted the trees into a low perimeter wall
        - Leto took watch with Eros
            - A mysterious "shrub" caught her eye
            - A dropship descended towards Evergreen, then suddenly took a hit and crashed violently somewhere south of the colony
                - Contingency White wouldn't have Union IFF codes, and the orbital derelicts have been real hostile towards non-Union
            - The mysterious "shrub" had vanished in the meantime, no clues were found
                - "It was like a really big spider, short and really wide" - Eros
        - Everyone takes +2 forward (+1 from good food, +1 from comfy shelter)
    - Night: Part 2 of resting
        - Tempo took over watch
            - There was a lot of fire where the dropship crashed

                - Participants: Bitterness[E] (PoV), Terror[E]
                - B is scared bc they are losing badly, T is determined to protect the Queen at all costs.
                - B loves T, and wants more meaning in life than a death in war.
                - T feels B is too influenced by humans, and longs too much for peace.
                - T demands B's sword, B hands it over and T heads into battle.
                - B retreats to the bunker, finding a human and a scribe and helping them open the stuck gate.
                - Hearing war machines approach, B begins to close the portal, but a viscous oil floods in.
                - The oil is a nanomachine swarm that pulls B deeper to talk to him.
                    - (B can hear the horrid intent behind its programming???)
                - B asserts superiority over this monster, and pity for it and the human who died instantly from spinal trauma.
                - The swarm froths with hatred for Egregorians.
            - Castrati was overtaken by the remains of the nanite swarm, and Panda+Leto's best attempts could only hold it at bay until he argued it into submission
                - There was an Egregorian shelter here (in the crevasse?)
            - Then Leto + Tempo argued about something, something living in Tempo's head?

`Current time: Afternoon on Day 2, we will probably spend what remains of this segment, plus the evening/night segments, exploring the Egregorian shelter presumably under the oil lake in the crevasse (which is on fire).`

## Session 32
### The Journey
- Day 2: First leg - Evergreen to Mt. Cooper
    - Afternoon: Through a crevasse
        - After putting out the fire on the oil lake, we lowered the SE down, and the SSU climbed in.
            - L climbs down the wall of the cavern, finding fist-sized holes bored in the ceiling.
            - C submerges the SE and finds an orbital rod+cluster munition embedded in the floor. The impact in fact split the entire mountain down to this point.
            - C also finds the shattered remains of likely the/an Egregorian queen, too ruined to recover easily.
    - Evening: Up the mountainside
        - T scouts, there are subalterns visibly shadowing us.
        - C navigates, we get lost.
    - Night
        - Around the campfire:
            - We argue a lot, Panda is shot when Leto negligently discharges her lightning-gun.
            - The second bell, the one Tempo recovered from the Firedancer, is revealed.
            - We watch the message from Dthall Ordo.

        - We push through the swarm of subalterns protecting The Tower, and we keep The Shepherd safe, but the HI goes down, and Tempo is unconscious in the ambulance suite.
        - Artemis, in The Shepherd, asks us to protect her while she completes her upload.
        - Psalm and Castrati take a stance against Artemis, and Panda follows. Leto takes the offered hand of Beggar One.
