The company was founded by Jun Chandrasekhar, a gladiator pilot and revolutionary leader, along with former racing pilot Mattias Herschel. The initial license of incorporation was granted to Chandrasekhar as a boon for her performance in the arena by self-appointed Emir Julian Ambrose Khan during his tyrannical rule over the world of Suldan. Chandrasekhar made use of the printer permissions granted to her as part of incorporation to manufacture mechs and weaponry, covertly equipping the beleaguered rebellion effort against the Emir. Mattias Herschel, a member of Suldan's upper class who had been a prestigious chassis racer before his retirement, was sympathetic towards the rebels and lent both his engineering expertise and his air of legitimacy to Chandrasekhar's fledgling endeavor.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Emir's most recent death, both Chandraskehar and Herschel discovered that their joint venture had attracted a growing and dedicated base of pilots actively seeking out their licenses for use elsewhere. With infusions of capital and designs from investors who prefer to remain anonymous, C&H Ltd. continued to expand their offerings, and while they have a ways to go before they rise to the ranks of corporations such as IPS-N Northstar or Smith-Shimano, forward-looking projections remain optimistic as advertising and positive word of mouth continues to spread.<br><br>C&H focuses on what they refer to as “unorthodox combat solutions,” providing specialized designs that larger corporations have eschewed or are slow in pivoting towards.

Originally starting out as a space exploration and stellar cartography company, constantly on the look out for inhabitable planets and deep space mining opportunities, Intercorp™ has since risen to power by being a majority shareholder in many of the smaller companies founded on planets first discovered by them. While this makes Intercorp™ a vast and expansive corporation it also means that it is mostly decentralized, unable to bring its full power to bear on any focused goal.</p> <p>Despite that, or rather because of that fact, Intercorp™ has become one of the largest employers for mercenaries, hiring skilled individuals, soldiers of fortune and sometimes less prestigious characters for various agendas and odd-jobs all over the galaxy. Intercorp™ isn't following any particular overarching scheme with these actions, it is instead the myriad of Intercorp™ branches which are planning and conducting these operations of their own accord. While company officials won't state so publicly, Intercorp™ branches have even been known to clash in open hostilities when their agendas are at odds, hiring mercenary outfits to oppose each other in all out proxy wars over conflicting goals.</p> <p>The most famous asset at Intercorp™'s disposal is undoubtedly Interpoint Station, an excessively vast and advanced space station capable of utilizing Intercorp™'s so called \\\"Interblink™\\\" blinkdrive, an ominous device capable of shifting the entire station to any point within the known galaxy at a moment's notice. While nobody is entirely sure how Interpoint Station came to be, rumors have it that Intercorp™ stumbled upon it in its early years of space exploration, derelict and abandoned, seemingly constructed by an unknown party. While unproven, the theory is supported by the fact that the company doesn't actually seem to be able to replicate the technology that makes Interpoint so unique.</p> <p>Since its comissioning, Interpoint Station has quickly become a thorn in the side of many on the galactic stage. Popping up erratically at seemingly the most inorpportune times just to thwart somebody's plans, lay claim to some stake or to pursue some matter entirely unrelated. Despite that, retribution or fallout from most of these actions have yet to seriously affect either Intercorp™ or Interpoint, owing to the decentralized nature in the former's case and to the fact that escape is always just one blink jump away in the latter's.</p>\",\"quote\":\"<i>Intercorp™ hopes to be working with you again.</i>\",\"logo_url\":\"https://i.imgur.com/D57wZvk.png\",\"brew\":\"0vOd40jFpVba3gcZoY7npTrGT3U=\"}],\"factions\":[],\"backgrounds\":[],\"coreBonuses\":[{\"id\":\"cb_broadband_scanners\",\"name\":\"BROADBAND SCANNERS™️\",\"source\":\"IC\",\"description\":\"Battlefield awareness is key and no one is more keenly aware of that fact than Intercorp™ Lancers.

Zalewski Telecomm’s Board of Directors had mixed feelings about his ascension; he was notoriously flighty and unstable, hardly the type to assume his father’s firm, controlling hand. Their suspicions were proven correct. Zalewski VI was determined to shake up the company and seek out new markets, pushing its influence far out into the lawless reaches of the Rim. To support this new expansion, he turned much of the company’s assets (and the entirety of his considerable fortune) towards a project he called Waffenfabrik Zalewski, frequently represented as “Wa.Zal”: a “budget military systems contractor.”<br><br>Wa.Zal would only remain active for 11 years, nearly bankrupting Zalewski Telecomm in the process.

Each suit on Sparr bears the history of its previous pilots in both decorations and FCA-compliant machine learning, which enables Sparri hunters to almost literally call upon their ancestors in battle.

Capital ships, the problem posits, are incredibly expensive, demand a tremendous amount of time for corpros and Diasporan states to produce and maintain, and increasingly outmatched by anti-ship weaponry. In a conventional capital duel, a successful kill means the death of thousands of personnel and the loss of millions of units of manna; this makes many commanders gun-shy, encouraging them to rely on subline vessels and fighters to accomplish battle objectives rather than risk their big ships. This strategy tends to prove just as expensive: instead of one or a handful of large ships being destroyed, signifying the end of a battle, engagements can grind on for weeks as squadrons of smaller ships engage inside the unpredictability gap, inching towards victory. </p> <p>IPS-N was the first to crack the Yemanova Problem. The corpro's designers identified the need for a rapidly deployable, sub-signature, directed weapon. It needed to be well-armed and well-armored, small enough to enter a ship and efficiently neutralize personnel in order to achieve victory. IPS-N created the Caliban to solve this need. </p> <p>Cultural critics argue that mechanized chassis venerate the form of a particular humanity; it is an unconscious nod towards the anthrochauvinist roots of the machine among leading designers and fabricators. The Caliban is not that. It was never intended to be an image of man writ large, striding across the battlefield heroically to affect a greater purpose. </p> <p>Unlike many IPS-N frames, the Caliban has no roots in early attempts at self-defense by freighter crews and asteroid miners. It was not born from ingenuity - there is no legacy of resilience, heroism, or the frontier spirit to paper over the purpose of its birth. It has no civilian applications in aid, disaster relief, construction, or farming; it does not build, defend, or inspire &ndash; it was designed to solve a numbers problem on a ledger. </p> <p>It is a tool designed to kill human beings very, very quickly. </p>\",\"mounts\":[\"Heavy\"],\"stats\":{\"size\":0.5,\"structure\":4,\"stress\":4,\"armor\":2,\"hp\":6,\"evasion\":8,\"edef\":8,\"heatcap\":5,\"repcap\":5,\"sensor_range\":3,\"tech_attack\":-2,\"save\":11,\"speed\":3,\"sp\":5},\"traits\":[{\"name\":\"Wrecking Ball\",\"description\":\"The Caliban counts as Size 3 when inflicting knockback with any Ram, Ranged, or Melee Attack.\",\"synergies\":[{\"locations\":[\"weapon\"],\"weapon_types\":[\"any\"],\"weapon_sizes\":[\"any\"],\"detail\":\"The Caliban counts as size 3 when inflicting knockback from any ranged or melee attack.\"}]},{\"name\":\"Pursue Prey\",\"description\":\"When the Caliban inflicts KNOCKBACK as part of any action, it can move an equal number of spaces towards the same target by the most direct route possible.

A relative unknown before the incident, MSMC documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong's personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on MSMC's report. </p> <p>In her logbook, Xiong noted that her chassis, a factory-standard IPS-N Raleigh, was almost totally ripped apart in the chaos of the White Tiger's attack. Thrown free of her billeted freighter after it collided with a White Tiger crashboat, Xiong managed to survive the next 45 days by scavenging across the drifting, derelict wreck of the MSMC-S Say No More, the escort cruiser attached to the supply colony. Outnumbered and hunted by the White Tiger pirates prowling the ruined convoy, Xiong took dramatic steps to modify her Raleigh for close-quarters combat. In the dark, claustrophobic environments of the Say No More and ruined freighters leashed to it by the White Tigers, Xiong turned her chassis into a machine of tumbling death. </p> <p>Xiong likely did not survive the long engagement. She is presumed to have perished mere days before an IPS-N Trunk Security patrol arrived, responding to the convoy's initial distress signal. Trunk Security found that Xiong had eliminated every White Tiger pirate assigned to the convoy; her chassis, logbook, and trace elements of her body were discovered in the White Tiger's cored-out gunboat and recovered by IPS-N. Thanks to her efforts, Trunk Security and MSMC were able to hunt down the remaining White Tiger gang and eliminate them. IPS-N and MSMC then engaged in a lengthy negotiation over the modified Raleigh's plans, eventually settling on a mixed licensing fee that benefits both IPS-N and MSMC. The resulting pattern, the Zheng, is now a popular choice among MSMC and Trunk Security pilots operating across the Rim. </p> <p>Xiong Xiaoli is widely regarded as a bodhisattva across the Long Rim; MSMC mercenaries have created several drinking games named after her, and MSMC pilots on combat contracts often compete to hit the \\\"Xiong Limit\\\" of 45+ confirmed kills. </p>\",\"mounts\":[\"Main\",\"Main\",\"Heavy\"],\"stats\":{\"size\":1,\"structure\":4,\"stress\":4,\"armor\":2,\"hp\":10,\"evasion\":9,\"edef\":6,\"heatcap\":6,\"repcap\":6,\"sensor_range\":3,\"tech_attack\":-2,\"save\":10,\"speed\":3,\"sp\":5},\"traits\":[{\"name\":\"Destructive Swings\",\"description\":\"At the end of the Zheng’s turn, if it made at least one melee attack against a hostile character, the force of its swings creates a SIZE 1 piece of terrain that grants hard cover in a free, adjacent space.
