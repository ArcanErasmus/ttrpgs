This allows the ionizing beam to maintain cohesion at a far greater distance, and a similarly upgraded power feed pushes the bounds of what an infantry-carried weapon can output. While the BAP-2 requires significant charging time between shots at range, it can sustain continuous discharge at extremely short distances. When the extra focusing lenses are fitted, the BAP-2 can substitute for a cutting torch, albeit a very heavy
