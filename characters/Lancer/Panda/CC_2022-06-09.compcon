Zalewski Telecomm’s Board of Directors had mixed feelings about his ascension; he was notoriously flighty and unstable, hardly the type to assume his father’s firm, controlling hand. Their suspicions were proven correct. Zalewski VI was determined to shake up the company and seek out new markets, pushing its influence far out into the lawless reaches of the Rim. To support this new expansion, he turned much of the company’s assets (and the entirety of his considerable fortune) towards a project he called Waffenfabrik Zalewski, frequently represented as “Wa.Zal”: a “budget military systems contractor.”<br><br>Wa.Zal would only remain active for 11 years, nearly bankrupting Zalewski Telecomm in the process. By the time the Board had forced Zalewski VI out of his position, the company was haemorrhaging money and had produced a full line of moderately successful combat mechs- mechs whose solid reputation was not nearly enough to repay the gargantuan cost of developing them. Mechs bearing the Zalewski design can still be found across the Rim and other frontier areas, though their parent company scrupulously refuses to support them or the Wa.Zal brand.\",\"quote\":\"<i>“Built Better, Built Zalewski”</i>\",\"brew\":\"iXa60PEfIjpA/dXXNbIhOB0nDNQ=\"}],\"factions\":[],\"backgrounds\":[],\"coreBonuses\":[{\"id\":\"wz_cb_aftermarket_upgrades\",\"name\":\"Aftermarket Upgrades\",\"source\":\"WAZAL\",\"effect\":\"Each time you reprint your mech, you may choose to remove the effects of one of its Frame Traits.\",\"description\":\"<i>While Zalewski has not allowed the Wa.Zal licenses into the public domain, pirated or modified forks of them, as well as home-built modifications, are ubiquitous.</i>\",\"brew\":\"iXa60PEfIjpA/dXXNbIhOB0nDNQ=\"},{\"id\":\"wz_cb_explosive_reactive_armour\",\"name\":\"EXPLOSIVE REACTIVE ARMOUR\",\"source\":\"WAZAL\",\"effect\":\"Your mech gains the ERA System, which costs 0 SP and has Unique and Limited 3.

The initial license of incorporation was granted to Chandrasekhar as a boon for her performance in the arena by self-appointed Emir Julian Ambrose Khan during his tyrannical rule over the world of Suldan. Chandrasekhar made use of the printer permissions granted to her as part of incorporation to manufacture mechs and weaponry, covertly equipping the beleaguered rebellion effort against the Emir. Mattias Herschel, a member of Suldan's upper class who had been a prestigious chassis racer before his retirement, was sympathetic towards the rebels and lent both his engineering expertise and his air of legitimacy to Chandrasekhar's fledgling endeavor.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Emir's most recent death, both Chandraskehar and Herschel discovered that their joint venture had attracted a growing and dedicated base of pilots actively seeking out their licenses for use elsewhere. With infusions of capital and designs from investors who prefer to remain anonymous, C&H Ltd. continued to expand their offerings, and while they have a ways to go before they rise to the ranks of corporations such as IPS-N Northstar or Smith-Shimano, forward-looking projections remain optimistic as advertising and positive word of mouth continues to spread.<br><br>C&H focuses on what they refer to as “unorthodox combat solutions,” providing specialized designs that larger corporations have eschewed or are slow in pivoting towards.

Originally starting out as a space exploration and stellar cartography company, constantly on the look out for inhabitable planets and deep space mining opportunities, Intercorp™ has since risen to power by being a majority shareholder in many of the smaller companies founded on planets first discovered by them. While this makes Intercorp™ a vast and expansive corporation it also means that it is mostly decentralized, unable to bring its full power to bear on any focused goal.</p> <p>Despite that, or rather because of that fact, Intercorp™ has become one of the largest employers for mercenaries, hiring skilled individuals, soldiers of fortune and sometimes less prestigious characters for various agendas and odd-jobs all over the galaxy. Intercorp™ isn't following any particular overarching scheme with these actions, it is instead the myriad of Intercorp™ branches which are planning and conducting these operations of their own accord. While company officials won't state so publicly, Intercorp™ branches have even been known to clash in open hostilities when their agendas are at odds, hiring mercenary outfits to oppose each other in all out proxy wars over conflicting goals.</p> <p>The most famous asset at Intercorp™'s disposal is undoubtedly Interpoint Station, an excessively vast and advanced space station capable of utilizing Intercorp™'s so called \\\"Interblink™\\\" blinkdrive, an ominous device capable of shifting the entire station to any point within the known galaxy at a moment's notice. While nobody is entirely sure how Interpoint Station came to be, rumors have it that Intercorp™ stumbled upon it in its early years of space exploration, derelict and abandoned, seemingly constructed by an unknown party. While unproven, the theory is supported by the fact that the company doesn't actually seem to be able to replicate the technology that makes Interpoint so unique.</p> <p>Since its comissioning, Interpoint Station has quickly become a thorn in the side of many on the galactic stage. Popping up erratically at seemingly the most inorpportune times just to thwart somebody's plans, lay claim to some stake or to pursue some matter entirely unrelated. Despite that, retribution or fallout from most of these actions have yet to seriously affect either Intercorp™ or Interpoint, owing to the decentralized nature in the former's case and to the fact that escape is always just one blink jump away in the latter's.</p>\",\"quote\":\"<i>Intercorp™ hopes to be working with you again.</i>\",\"logo_url\":\"https://i.imgur.com/D57wZvk.png\",\"brew\":\"0vOd40jFpVba3gcZoY7npTrGT3U=\"}],\"factions\":[],\"backgrounds\":[],\"coreBonuses\":[{\"id\":\"cb_broadband_scanners\",\"name\":\"BROADBAND SCANNERS™️\",\"source\":\"IC\",\"description\":\"Battlefield awareness is key and no one is more keenly aware of that fact than Intercorp™ Lancers.

The shadowy rogue subsidiary of IPS-N “known” as DOWNFALL has a rather plain beginning on paper, which paints an official role in predictive investment, pre-emptive military intervention, corporate espionage, and economic sabotage. However, the spiritual beginning of DOWNFALL is a simple statement: “We endorse and support the mission of Albatross.”<br><br>The danger inherent in believing something is that you will act on that belief.<br><br>The deep gulf that now exists between the internal culture of DOWNFALL Group and its parent company began with trends in the data. Competitor opportunities cut short by the successful establishment of human rights in a given system, Albatross interventions uncovering unethical experimentation on human life, colonies collapsed by reckless shortcuts meant to make them productive faster than they could be stable. While IPS-N touted support of humanitarian missions with one hand, the other was stained with the same blood and gold as the rest of its peers. Disillusionment gave rise to action and the oh-so-very unofficial shift of DOWNFALL Group’s mission from support of its parent company to wide-reaching action against human rights violations and, more broadly, the willful perpetuation of a chaotic galaxy for the benefit of the powerful.<br><br>Current thinking in DOWNFALL’s leadership places corpro-states as the largest enemies of human peace and prosperity, and prioritizes their destruction and Union’s preservation, in that order, to fulfill its humanitarian mandate. The reality is rarely as clean as swift insertions to dispense justice; DOWNFALL is reliant on the resources and privileged intelligence it leeches from IPS-N to operate, and trades heavily on the secrecy of its mission in order to stay safe. Strikes have to be directed for maximum effect with as few risks and resources as possible, and though DOWNFALL rejects the corporate culture of profit over people, it was still born of that culture. In the heat of the moment, DOWNFALL has sometimes chosen to put its cause above the real people they are ostensibly trying to help in order to set up for future efforts, sorely testing the loyalty of its pilots.<br><br>DOWNFALL’s “Sinner” pattern-groups, fielded almost solely by their own agents or rebellions they back, are culled from aborted research in IPS-N’s own archives added to a pool of specifications and schematics stolen via their espionage efforts, and inspired by the success of HORUS p-g operations. Most take pains to resemble a more standardized chassis, generally from IPS-N, with the few slip-ups of operational security to date chalked up to ‘prototypes’. Still, it’s only a matter of time before DOWNFALL is formally discovered, and will have to take action to preserve its own existence. To this end, select mercenary groups - notably and especially including Albatross - have been given limited licensing in order to prepare the way for DOWNFALL’s emergence into the public sphere. Quietly, patiently, they gather networks of contacts, contractors, and resources ever so slightly separate from what they report and turn over to IPS-N, forming a new cloak for its mission: preserve Union, and bring glory to mankind.\",\"quote\":\"<i>Thinking Forward</i>\",\"logo_url\":\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/n89d8cukqmxbist/DOWNFALL_corplogo.svg?raw=1\",\"brew\":\"7YUK7/BfkvIzIY9JtPJhu6nlDk4=\"},{\"id\":\"MOI\",\"name\":\"Magnum Opus Interstellar\",\"logo_url\":\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/co7gjb68dkpnxmr/moi-simplified.svg?raw=1\",\"light\":\"#4e1ed7\",\"dark\":\"#dddddd\",\"quote\":\"<i>From Dreams to Design</i>\",\"description\":\"Magnum Opus Interstellar is one of the longest-lasting design companies in the Union that has not been absorbed by one of the major corporations. The reason for this despite the company’s rather small size is because Magnum Opus Interstellar are a premier developer of new components and designs for blink gates, keeping them stable and safe for many systems. This contract directly with the DoIT itself has allowed it to maintain independence and resist attempts to buy it out several times.<br><br>The heavy work they do with blink gates has also given them a closer (though by no means close) relationship with the Voladores than most members of Union. They often trade survey data from Voladore traders to more carefully tailor the plans for a planned blink gate to the system it will be inhabiting. As a result of this more common contact, Magnum Opus Interstellar often sells what they call ‘Voladore Inspired’ technology, though they are very insistent that they have never engaged in theft of it - and the continued trading with their primary facility, the New Agartha blink gate station, indicates that the Voladore believe they are honest.<br><br>Magnum Opus designs are primarily defensively based, skilled in evasion and trickery over direct conflict. While not pacifistic like the Voladore, Magnum Opus has made it clear that peace and exploration is much more profitable to them than war. Money spent on military campaigns is, after all, not being spent on new expeditions to create colonies that will require a blink gate. Despite this, their designs are popular among those with an interest in blinkspace technology. This is thanks to MOI's tendency to use the Voladore-inspired technology in ways that allow their mechs to move in an unexpected, or even seemingly impossible fashion.\",\"brew\":\"7YUK7/BfkvIzIY9JtPJhu6nlDk4=\"},{\"id\":\"MO & S\",\"name\":\"Marley, Oz, and Silver Lending & Consultations\",\"light\":\"#294c69\",\"dark\":\"#4c8ec4\",\"description\":\"Marley, Oz, and Silver is a youngblood lending service that is officially in over its head. The idea, in 4985u, was simple enough to start with. Jacob Marley, a retired pilot with years of service for the DoJ, partnered with childhood friend & financier Jane Silver to try and support the promise of Union in their own way. Over the course of their mutual work they had seen many cases of injustice lesser than those prosecuted so vigorously by the DoJ’s Liberators, but all the more insidious for it: citizen-shareholders chained by student debts, human beings denied the legal right to their own genetic code, religions in the Baronies dedicated to raising their captive adherents in darkness. Marley and Silver didn’t set out to create a mercenary company; the Albatross and MIRRORSMOKE served as fine second-chance opportunities for soldiers already. They started a lending company with the goal of getting debtors out of situations they could not otherwise escape, and to assist in this endeavor they brought on Marley’s old partner: an NHP named Oz, developed over Marley’s long years of service in the manner of some pilots.<br><br>Recruiting interested parties was surprisingly easy. Even a dark galaxy is full of points of light, after all, candles that brighten when placed together. At the advice of their consultants, Marley, Oz, and Silver adopted a stance of converting debts not into forgiveness but into an actually payable structure; many of the desperate folk they sought to help were rightfully wary of charity, and were easier to persuade with a fair deal rooted in returned value. Unfortunately this is where things went sideways, as the budding lending company found itself in possession of an incredibly wide swathe of skills with no real plan for how to dispose of those skills. By mutual agreement, Oz’s identity - already hidden - was buried deep, and they were appointed the shadowy head of Marley, Oz, and Silver’s newfound Consultations branch, where Union, corpro, and citizens alike could hire their stable of skilled specialists for whatever problems those specialists might solve. With an increasing need to avoid the wrath of corpro-states whose citizens they were liberating, Marley, Oz, and Silver relocated their headquarters to the Annamite line, and their various installations into uncharted territory. Far from home and far from help, Oz directed its engineers to develop a line of mechs suitable for home defense, far-field exploration, and sale in the secondary market.<br><br>Today, Marley, Oz, and Silver is only a fraction of overall frame sales, easily outnumbered even by HORUS’s offerings, but they are growing a reputation for reliability. Where other frames crap out and need to be printed again from the ground up, MO & S’s “Unyielding” line is ready to go again with a spitshine and a few swear words, no matter how hard they get beat down. Though MO & S’s portfolio is diverse, they do sometimes get hard hits in the galactic market, and a recent spell of trouble has caused an aggressive push of their military-grade products to make ends meet, with groups like MIRRORSMOKE and the Ungratefuls among their foremost buyers. Need it cheap, long-lasting, and don’t much care if it’s pretty?

Thanks to a long-running research project from SSC's Exotic Materials Group, the designers were able to employ the bleeding edge of reactor miniaturization tech: the result was a chassis that resembled a large, sleek hardsuit, almost skintight in places. While the Atlas sacrifices the durability of a larger frame, its essential systems are so closely melded with its user's movements that it offers unparalleled maneuverability.</p> <p>Although the Atlas was initially licensed only to Baronic clients, its design was leaked when a group of ExoMat personnel lost a suit to a Sparri espada in an intense game of Kapkat. Despite their initial attempt to recover the suit, SSC relented, citing the eager demand from Sparri groups for access to the full license. </p> <p>Considered the perfect warrior frame for hunting the native megafauna of Sparr, the Atlas now enjoys a dual reputation among both the Sparri peoples and Karrakin nobility. To the Sparri, the Atlas &ndash; its combat efficacy notwithstanding &ndash; is highly valued for the direct access its systems allow to their ancestral memory; Atlas frames on Sparr are the heirlooms of great warriors, tied to family (blood and chosen) and maintained by hand.

Unlike many of IPS-N's modern frames, the Caliban was designed from the ground up to be a military machine. </p> <p>The Caliban is IPS-N's solution to the  \\\"Yemanova \\\" Problem, more properly known as the Impact-Override Problem. Capital ships, the problem posits, are incredibly expensive, demand a tremendous amount of time for corpros and Diasporan states to produce and maintain, and increasingly outmatched by anti-ship weaponry. In a conventional capital duel, a successful kill means the death of thousands of personnel and the loss of millions of units of manna; this makes many commanders gun-shy, encouraging them to rely on subline vessels and fighters to accomplish battle objectives rather than risk their big ships. This strategy tends to prove just as expensive: instead of one or a handful of large ships being destroyed, signifying the end of a battle, engagements can grind on for weeks as squadrons of smaller ships engage inside the unpredictability gap, inching towards victory. </p> <p>IPS-N was the first to crack the Yemanova Problem. The corpro's designers identified the need for a rapidly deployable, sub-signature, directed weapon. It needed to be well-armed and well-armored, small enough to enter a ship and efficiently neutralize personnel in order to achieve victory. IPS-N created the Caliban to solve this need. </p> <p>Cultural critics argue that mechanized chassis venerate the form of a particular humanity; it is an unconscious nod towards the anthrochauvinist roots of the machine among leading designers and fabricators. The Caliban is not that. It was never intended to be an image of man writ large, striding across the battlefield heroically to affect a greater purpose. </p> <p>Unlike many IPS-N frames, the Caliban has no roots in early attempts at self-defense by freighter crews and asteroid miners. It was not born from ingenuity - there is no legacy of resilience, heroism, or the frontier spirit to paper over the purpose of its birth.

A relative unknown before the incident, MSMC documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong's personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on MSMC's report. </p> <p>In her logbook, Xiong noted that her chassis, a factory-standard IPS-N Raleigh, was almost totally ripped apart in the chaos of the White Tiger's attack. Thrown free of her billeted freighter after it collided with a White Tiger crashboat, Xiong managed to survive the next 45 days by scavenging across the drifting, derelict wreck of the MSMC-S Say No More, the escort cruiser attached to the supply colony. Outnumbered and hunted by the White Tiger pirates prowling the ruined convoy, Xiong took dramatic steps to modify her Raleigh for close-quarters combat. In the dark, claustrophobic environments of the Say No More and ruined freighters leashed to it by the White Tigers, Xiong turned her chassis into a machine of tumbling death. </p> <p>Xiong likely did not survive the long engagement. She is presumed to have perished mere days before an IPS-N Trunk Security patrol arrived, responding to the convoy's initial distress signal. Trunk Security found that Xiong had eliminated every White Tiger pirate assigned to the convoy; her chassis, logbook, and trace elements of her body were discovered in the White Tiger's cored-out gunboat and recovered by IPS-N. Thanks to her efforts, Trunk Security and MSMC were able to hunt down the remaining White Tiger gang and eliminate them. IPS-N and MSMC then engaged in a lengthy negotiation over the modified Raleigh's plans, eventually settling on a mixed licensing fee that benefits both IPS-N and MSMC. The resulting pattern, the Zheng, is now a popular choice among MSMC and Trunk Security pilots operating across the Rim. </p> <p>Xiong Xiaoli is widely regarded as a bodhisattva across the Long Rim; MSMC mercenaries have created several drinking games named after her, and MSMC pilots on combat contracts often compete to hit the \\\"Xiong Limit\\\" of 45+ confirmed kills. </p>\",\"mounts\":[\"Main\",\"Main\",\"Heavy\"],\"stats\":{\"size\":1,\"structure\":4,\"stress\":4,\"armor\":2,\"hp\":10,\"evasion\":9,\"edef\":6,\"heatcap\":6,\"repcap\":6,\"sensor_range\":3,\"tech_attack\":-2,\"save\":10,\"speed\":3,\"sp\":5},\"traits\":[{\"name\":\"Destructive Swings\",\"description\":\"At the end of the Zheng’s turn, if it made at least one melee attack against a hostile character, the force of its swings creates a SIZE 1 piece of terrain that grants hard cover in a free, adjacent space.
