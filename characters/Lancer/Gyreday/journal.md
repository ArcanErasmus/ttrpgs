BG
- Gambled her way into a mech license
    - SSC is a good fit for this I think
- Not used to this lifestyle, no proper training
- I want there to be a hidden facet to her mech that she only uncovers later on
    - Something pushed the numbers in her favor to ensure she ended up in this mech?
        - Not only did she win the lottery by this, but some other life events railroaded her here
    - Something is hidden in the mech, it should scare the piss outta her
        - Latent NHP just waiting for her to bring it online
