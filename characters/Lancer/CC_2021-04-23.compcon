The company was founded by Jun Chandrasekhar, a gladiator pilot and revolutionary leader, along with former racing pilot Mattias Herschel. The initial license of incorporation was granted to Chandrasekhar as a boon for her performance in the arena by self-appointed Emir Julian Ambrose Khan during his tyrannical rule over the world of Suldan. Chandrasekhar made use of the printer permissions granted to her as part of incorporation to manufacture mechs and weaponry, covertly equipping the beleaguered rebellion effort against the Emir. Mattias Herschel, a member of Suldan's upper class who had been a prestigious chassis racer before his retirement, was sympathetic towards the rebels and lent both his engineering expertise and his air of legitimacy to Chandrasekhar's fledgling endeavor.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Emir's most recent death, both Chandraskehar and Herschel discovered that their joint venture had attracted a growing and dedicated base of pilots actively seeking out their licenses for use elsewhere. With infusions of capital and designs from investors who prefer to remain anonymous, C&H Ltd. continued to expand their offerings, and while they have a ways to go before they rise to the ranks of corporations such as IPS-N Northstar or Smith-Shimano, forward-looking projections remain optimistic as advertising and positive word of mouth continues to spread.<br><br>C&H focuses on what they refer to as “unorthodox combat solutions,” providing specialized designs that larger corporations have eschewed or are slow in pivoting towards. Their frames and licenses are frequently adapted from gladiatorial and sporting designs, and many of their weapons and systems were originally improvised and adapted, or as some contest pirated, from other sources. As a result of this, their mechs are as diverse as their origins, without the common thread that ties other corporations' licenses together.\",\"quote\":\"Special problems demand special solutions.\",\"brew\":\"1Mi3Wbbil+3odfyXBosYwb4fyH8=\"}],\"factions\":[],\"backgrounds\":[],\"coreBonuses\":[{\"id\":\"cb_all_environment_adaptation\",\"name\":\"All-Environment Adaptation\",\"source\":\"C&H\",\"effect\":\"Your mech has resistance against all damage, heat, and burn from environmental sources including dangerous terrain, and you gain +1 Accuracy to all checks and saves made to avoid, resist, or negate dangerous terrain, damage, or statuses and conditions imposed by environmental sources.\",\"description\":\"A chassis retrofit utilizing C&H's thermoregulation polymer mesh along with overlapping layers of radiation shielding, electronic systems hardening, and non-conductive ceramic matrix alloys, providing outfitted mechs with robust hostile environmental protection across multiple biomes.\",\"brew\":\"1Mi3Wbbil+3odfyXBosYwb4fyH8=\"},{\"id\":\"cb_autoextinguishers\",\"name\":\"Autoextinguishers\",\"source\":\"C&H\",\"effect\":\"1/round as a quick action, or whenever you take the Stabilize action, you may automatically clear all burn from your mech.\",\"description\":\"In the event of high-speed crashes and other similar catastrophic impact events the window for effective pilot recovery shortens drastically in the event of a cockpit fire.

Despite this, the AGRIPPA remains a military chassis first and foremost; for those who oppose the Armory, it is instead a symbol of relentless implacability, enabling Legionnaires to cross cut bridges and minefields, swiftly returning damaged chassis to fighting order, and reinforcing defensive positions into unassailable fortresses.

Mass produced and distributed to Purview forces wherever they may find themselves deployed, the multipurpose Comp/Con-enabled utility drone comes equipped with a variety of tools and hardware/firmware package options, and can be assigned to assist with tasks such as triage, spectral data analysis, explosive ordnance disposal, hardware diagnostics, communications relay, and combat engineering.

Thanks to a long-running research project from SSC's Exotic Materials Group, the designers were able to employ the bleeding edge of reactor miniaturization tech: the result was a chassis that resembled a large, sleek hardsuit, almost skintight in places. While the Atlas sacrifices the durability of a larger frame, its essential systems are so closely melded with its user's movements that it offers unparalleled maneuverability.</p> <p>Although the Atlas was initially licensed only to Baronic clients, its design was leaked when a group of ExoMat personnel lost a suit to a Sparri espada in an intense game of Kapkat. Despite their initial attempt to recover the suit, SSC relented, citing the eager demand from Sparri groups for access to the full license. </p> <p>Considered the perfect warrior frame for hunting the native megafauna of Sparr, the Atlas now enjoys a dual reputation among both the Sparri peoples and Karrakin nobility. To the Sparri, the Atlas &ndash; its combat efficacy notwithstanding &ndash; is highly valued for the direct access its systems allow to their ancestral memory; Atlas frames on Sparr are the heirlooms of great warriors, tied to family (blood and chosen) and maintained by hand. Each suit on Sparr bears the history of its previous pilots in both decorations and FCA-compliant machine learning, which enables Sparri hunters to almost literally call upon their ancestors in battle. The Atlas has become so popular among the Sparri that they even developed a new martial art based on the Atlas: Jäger Kunst. </p> <p>The Karrakin nobility, on the other hand, find the Atlas to be a perfect machine for noble heroism &ndash; that the Sparri have an affinity for it only makes the chassis that much more desirable among Karrakin Sparrist scholars.

Unlike many of IPS-N's modern frames, the Caliban was designed from the ground up to be a military machine. </p> <p>The Caliban is IPS-N's solution to the  \\\"Yemanova \\\" Problem, more properly known as the Impact-Override Problem. Capital ships, the problem posits, are incredibly expensive, demand a tremendous amount of time for corpros and Diasporan states to produce and maintain, and increasingly outmatched by anti-ship weaponry. In a conventional capital duel, a successful kill means the death of thousands of personnel and the loss of millions of units of manna; this makes many commanders gun-shy, encouraging them to rely on subline vessels and fighters to accomplish battle objectives rather than risk their big ships. This strategy tends to prove just as expensive: instead of one or a handful of large ships being destroyed, signifying the end of a battle, engagements can grind on for weeks as squadrons of smaller ships engage inside the unpredictability gap, inching towards victory. </p> <p>IPS-N was the first to crack the Yemanova Problem. The corpro's designers identified the need for a rapidly deployable, sub-signature, directed weapon. It needed to be well-armed and well-armored, small enough to enter a ship and efficiently neutralize personnel in order to achieve victory. IPS-N created the Caliban to solve this need. </p> <p>Cultural critics argue that mechanized chassis venerate the form of a particular humanity; it is an unconscious nod towards the anthrochauvinist roots of the machine among leading designers and fabricators. The Caliban is not that. It was never intended to be an image of man writ large, striding across the battlefield heroically to affect a greater purpose. </p> <p>Unlike many IPS-N frames, the Caliban has no roots in early attempts at self-defense by freighter crews and asteroid miners. It was not born from ingenuity - there is no legacy of resilience, heroism, or the frontier spirit to paper over the purpose of its birth.

A relative unknown before the incident, MSMC documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong's personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on MSMC's report. </p> <p>In her logbook, Xiong noted that her chassis, a factory-standard IPS-N Raleigh, was almost totally ripped apart in the chaos of the White Tiger's attack. Thrown free of her billeted freighter after it collided with a White Tiger crashboat, Xiong managed to survive the next 45 days by scavenging across the drifting, derelict wreck of the MSMC-S Say No More, the escort cruiser attached to the supply colony. Outnumbered and hunted by the White Tiger pirates prowling the ruined convoy, Xiong took dramatic steps to modify her Raleigh for close-quarters combat. In the dark, claustrophobic environments of the Say No More and ruined freighters leashed to it by the White Tigers, Xiong turned her chassis into a machine of tumbling death. </p> <p>Xiong likely did not survive the long engagement. She is presumed to have perished mere days before an IPS-N Trunk Security patrol arrived, responding to the convoy's initial distress signal. Trunk Security found that Xiong had eliminated every White Tiger pirate assigned to the convoy; her chassis, logbook, and trace elements of her body were discovered in the White Tiger's cored-out gunboat and recovered by IPS-N. Thanks to her efforts, Trunk Security and MSMC were able to hunt down the remaining White Tiger gang and eliminate them. IPS-N and MSMC then engaged in a lengthy negotiation over the modified Raleigh's plans, eventually settling on a mixed licensing fee that benefits both IPS-N and MSMC. The resulting pattern, the Zheng, is now a popular choice among MSMC and Trunk Security pilots operating across the Rim. </p> <p>Xiong Xiaoli is widely regarded as a bodhisattva across the Long Rim; MSMC mercenaries have created several drinking games named after her, and MSMC pilots on combat contracts often compete to hit the \\\"Xiong Limit\\\" of 45+ confirmed kills. </p>\",\"mounts\":[\"Main\",\"Main\",\"Heavy\"],\"stats\":{\"size\":1,\"structure\":4,\"stress\":4,\"armor\":2,\"hp\":10,\"evasion\":9,\"edef\":6,\"heatcap\":6,\"repcap\":6,\"sensor_range\":3,\"tech_attack\":-2,\"save\":10,\"speed\":3,\"sp\":5},\"traits\":[{\"name\":\"Destructive Swings\",\"description\":\"At the end of the Zheng’s turn, if it made at least one melee attack against a hostile character, the force of its swings creates a SIZE 1 piece of terrain that grants hard coverin a free, adjacent space.
