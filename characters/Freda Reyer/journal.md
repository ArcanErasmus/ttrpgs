# Sister Freda Reyer's Journal

## Adventure Log
- Took barge from Nuln, headed towards Ubersreik. Stopped for the night north of Grissenwald, at the Three Feathers Inn. I and some sailors lost some money to Siegbert in a game of cards. Siegbert tried to speak Classical to a scholar, but the inkeeper thought it was "witch speak" and got annoyed. A halfling (Glimbrin Oddsocks) seemed to be plotting something, because he was surrounded with the Winds of Magic.
- MUL arrived at the tavern, and discussed some business with Seedling (had to do with a party?)
- A man died suddenly, a servant ran off. He was poisoned!
