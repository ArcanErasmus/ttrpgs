# Sister Freda Reyer's Bio & Group Notes
## Short Bio
Freda grew up on a cattle ranch just north of Grenzstadt, in Averland, by the banks of the River Krebs. At the age of 12, an Orc raid swept through the countryside farmlands, killing her family, save for two of her older sisters. After taking a ship to Wuppertal, rowing with the crew to pay for her passage, she was scouted by a member of the Order of the Leviathan, with whom she studied and trained for the next four years. At the age of 16, she was ordained an Orca Priest in Kemperbad. Her next job took her to Nuln, where she ended up on the same barge to Ubersreik as the rest of the party. And so we begin, the night of Wellentag, 5/6/2512.

## Appearance
- Very young woman with green eyes, and golden brown hair secured in a single braid that wraps around the back of her head, covered by a whale-shaped hat.
- Dark blue-gray outfit, ceremonial, but simple for ease of movement, with the torso covered by a leather jacket, with a large engraving of a trident across the back. A small anchor charm hangs around her neck.
- A rifle is strapped across her back, with a very short trident sheathed on her left side, next to a pouch. A laden sling bag rests on her right side.

## Personality
- Where are you from?
Just north of Grenzstadt, in Averland. A small ranch on the north side of the River Krebs.
- What is your family like?
My parents were cattle ranchers, with my two eldest sisters helping out. My two middle brothers had joined the militia. One of my middle sisters had left on a merchant vessel, and the other was apprenticing as a stablehand when she was killed by a horse that panicked.
- What was your childhood like?
I only had about a year of helping with household chores, mainly being watched by my second oldest sister. In the spring of 2508 a large orc raid swept through the Black Fire Pass, and my family was wiped out. In the aftermath, I left on a merchant barge, paying for my passage by rowing with the crew. I don't know the location of my two older sisters that might have survived: the one that kept me safe during their invasion, and the one that left on a merchant ship several years ago. The older had stayed behind to rebuild a farm with the survivors, and the younger hadn't written home.
- Why did you leave home?
After the lands outside the walls were sacked, my sister secured me passage to Wuppertal on a merchant barge. After joining another crew in Wuppertal headed west, I was recruited by a Leviathan serving the ship. I followed the Leviathan to study the teachings of Manann and train to fight for the Order.
- Who are your best friends?
My couple friends from Grenzstadt are dead or scattered, and friends on the ships' crews come and go. The closest thing to a friend would be my mentor, a Leviathan Priest named Marton "Big Daryl" Nemeth.
- What is your greatest desire?
Become a Master Leviathan!
- What are your best and worst memories?
Worst: Losing my family and home. Best: Being ordained as an Orca Priest in Kemperbad.
- What are your religious beliefs?
Devoutly follow the teachings of Manann. The waterways are the arteries of the Empire and even the world. Manann provides, but also tests your resolve in harsh storms.
- To whom, or what, are you loyal?
Loyalty first and foremost is to the teachings of Manann and the Order (no conflict between these has yet arisen).
- Why are you adventuring?
Earn a living so that I can settle down somewhere a safe distance from the southeastern border of the Empire. Spread devotion to Manann, and keep the waters safe from the evil influences of Stromfels. Eventually, maybe even shoot some fucking orcs.
