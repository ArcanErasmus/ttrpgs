# Mage Brainstorming
## Margaret "Max Stats" Statler - The A/V Kid

### Family
- Parents own local radio shack in the singular small mall?
    - Mall: Radio Shack, Chinese Takeout, Army recruiter she learns morse from, 
- Don't have lots of money, but can scrounge up kit

### Kit
- camcorder
- tape deck
- boombox
- inscrutiable device that "detects the supernatural" with technobabble
- walkie talkies
- a pager
- police CB radio
- too many D batteries

### Skills:
- can tune a tv
- knows morse code
- remembers at least 50% of the NATO phonetic alphabet, makes up the rest
- surprisingly in-shape cardio-wise from lugging around tons of equipment
- can decipher some amount of military/police radio chatter

### Magic:
- manipulates recordings by playing them forward/backward/fast/slow to hear/play "subliminal messages"
- plays sounds to mind control people or drive off ghosts or something
- spheres notes:
    - correspondence: scrying, warding
    - entropy: chaos?
    - forces: technology
    - matter: complex patterns, forging, refinement
    - mind: astral travel, communication, dreams?, emotion, mind-shielding, psychic combat, self-empowerment, social programming
    - spirit: spirit sight
    - time: ham radio cross-universe
- interesting combinations
    - correspondence + mind: telepathy, logical shortcuts/deduction
    - mind + matter: imbue intelligence in nonliving (erica char)
    - mind + spirit:

### Personality:
- 12 years old
- believes the supernatural is everywhere around us always
- we can only tap into it with "advanced" technology
- always trying to capture a/v recordings to prove to adults she's not full of shit
- talks to the police on their radio because all of them are bored, they have to remind her to get back to her homework
- wears aviators
- minmaxer in her D&D group
- the only uncool kid with a boombox
- awakening: the detectificator started working. what changed/occured?

### Goals:
- turn mostly-abandoned listening post into personal lab/hideout/pirate radio
- get a dialup connection

### Questionable lore:
- convinced parents to get her a trainer bra just because she secretly wanted the perfect pocket to store batteries in and keep them warm
- knows how to phone phreak even though it's not useful any more
    - UPDATE: it might be useful because 2.6 KHz controlled trunks were still in use in parts of Alaska until 2011

### Group Relations
- Summer
    - Thought she was a ghost
    - Asked Autumn why her sister was a ghost
    - Invited her to D&D club
    - Showed up to D&D with a 7-page backstory dripping with edge and angst, Max reads it cover to cover several times
- Autumn
    - Shoved me out the door when I interrogated Autumn about ghost-ness
    - Showed up to D&D with Summer, made the most obnoxious Mary Sue murderhobo
