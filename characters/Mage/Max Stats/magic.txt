||==================================================================================================||
Rotes:
- Send location to/from Shadowlands (Spirit 3 + Optional Correspondence, 10 Successes)

corr (3)
- track thing
- learn path to thing
- see around corners/thru walls
- scry a loc or watch for scrying
- search universe for obj/creature
- set up jars and watch ripples to "learn information about the subject area"???
- check if objects have been moved with Correspondence in an area
- "track any irregularity back to its source"
- arc projectiles around cover/obstructions
- pull an object to your location from elsewhere
- travel with great speed, even instantaneously
    - a single step crosses leagues, move very fast, just plain teleport
    - optionally causes physical exhaustion
    - find unreproducable shortcuts
- bypass security
- determine location from limited information
- determine distance/direction/speed of an object/creature
- determine if object is being manipulated remotely, or if two Patterns are linked
- fold space so light passes around you
- strengthen or weaken the connection between objects
- protect small objects from being stolen via other Corr magic

spirit (3)
- create single-use fetish (talen), requires tass
- awaken an object spirit
- call out an introduction across the Dreamtime (to similar mages), an important courtesy
- locate Songlines previously introduced to
- strengthen or weaken the gauntlet
- see things that leave footprints in the Umbra (ghosts, spirits, werewolves, faeries, etc)
- soothe ghosts, push Wraiths into Slumber
- protect against being denied passage to the afterlife
- detect a spirit possessing/inhabiting a person/obj
- call out for a spirit
- ask questions to spirits
- commune with a spirit, who is confined to some ritual or physical barrier
- summon a Paradox Spirit
- ward against malevolent spirits
- raise or lower the Gauntlet/Shroud rating in your area

corr (3) + spirit (3)
- can scry in spirit worlds
- chant that kills a target (like Death Note?) by invoking why you want them dead
- detect boundaries/strength of the Dreamtime at location
- can enter to anywhere in the Umbra, or exit to anywhere on Earth
- send perception off into Umbra without actually moving there (presumably works in reverse)
- convert between ephemera and space, sense ephemera at distance, link spaces across the Gauntlet
- instantaneously travel along a Songline in the Dreamtime
- sense objects "touched by Sekhem"
- find nearby spirits and talk with them
- create a boundary spirits cannot cross
- call a Night Terror (or friendly spirit?) to torment (or soothe?) someone in their dreams
