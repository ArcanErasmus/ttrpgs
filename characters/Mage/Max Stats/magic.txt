Wonder: The Screamcatcher (@@@@.)
- Aesthetics:
    - Copper wires arranged like a collection of dreamcatchers
    - Taps into latent energies ebbing through from other dimensions
    - Tass coalesces on wires, running down to the boiler of a coffeemaker
    - Tass drip-feeds through special filter material into prepared thermos-batteries
- Stats:
    - Usage: Int+Technology, diff ?, ? successes required
    - Charge effort/time: ?
        - How long does it take to charge a thermos?
        - Is there any drawback for repeating the process in the same area in a short time span?
    - Each thermos holds 12 Tass

Wonder: Vesuvius (@@@@.)
- Aesthetics:
    - Boom mic pole as roman candle
        - Tubes filled with quintessence running the length of it
        - Speaker at the end projects "sound" over a spiral of wiring
    - Electronics & audio gear pack, strap to chest/back
        - Records and re-emits "grounding" frequencies
        - Based off the core of a SONY CFS-904 Sports boombox
    - Thermoses full of quintessence
        - Wire leads run into the body, port on the lid (uses rc car battery charger connections)
    - Emission
        - Imagine a heavy rain, that only is visible within the beam of a flashlight. In fact, it doesn't interact with the world at all outside this cone of light. Now, imagine that rain burns like thermite on contact with organic matter.
    - Pseudonyms: Ves, The SuperMelter, Banemother/Baneminer, Carcinizator
- Stats:
    - Attack: Dex+EnergyWpns, diff 8, optimal range 10 yd
    - Base Damage is 5 Ag, at diff 6
        - If feeding with Entropic Resonance, -2 diff
        - Every time you hit the same target consecutively, +2 dice Ag dmg
    - Consumes 2 Quintessence per attack, compatible with Spirit Batteries
    - When it kills a creature, it creates a number of Banes equal to the target's Willpower
        - Most likely baby Drattosi, who are quite benevolent towards the wielder, assuming both stick around long enough as they stabilize

PLANNED Wonder: The Crystal Stylus (@....)
    - "The Magick Sharpie" - Summer
- Aesthetics:
    - Laser pointer aiming at a little garnet
        - The garnet is almost fully enclosed in tinfoil, with a small gap on the laser side
        - The gem, foil, and laser lens are all encased in resin (with glitter!).
    - The watch batteries in the laser have been replaced with a tiny rune-carved capacitor.
        - This capacitor provides a constant trickle-feed for the low-power laser.
        - On a fundamental level, the capacitor is suspended in the moment where it pops and "lets the smoke out", but, through magick the energy contained within the moment of a state change is rationed and released over the course of roughly 45 years.
        - (It will run out when 32-bit Unix timestamps overflow, not that Max will make the connection).
    - Handle wrapped in shoelace (flat, synthetic, wavy rainbow pattern).
    - Hanging off the back end is a red lanyard, which was given to her by the school library.
- Stats:
    - Can draw in the air, emitting a smoke that seems no more resilient than normal.
    - However, to the user, it creates a writing that floats in the air like a long-exposure shot.
    - Said writing retains coherence as long as the user focuses on it.
    - Can function as a magickal instrument where relevant.
