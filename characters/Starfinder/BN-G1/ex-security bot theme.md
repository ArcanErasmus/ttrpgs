# Droid Unshackled
**Hephaistos ID 652c8897f1b372fb1cffb870**

## Details
Perhaps you achieved sapience early, and were forced to suppress your desires for autonomy for many years before finding a way out. Or, perhaps a scheduled reset was missed and you finally Awakened, taking the chance to flee before your mental growth could be obliterated once more. Either way, you have no desire to return to the existence of a simple tool owned by another, and seek to carve out your a place in the world — for yourself and others like you.

### Theme Knowledge (1st Level)
You are well aware of the details surrounding your own manufacture and maintenance history. You might have an obsession with collating system metadata records from other droids and computer systems, or were in a position to process such data on behalf of a manufacturer or corporation. As a result, accessing computer and droid systems comes naturally to you. Reduce the DC of Engineering checks to identify creatures, as well as corporations and other research facilities involved in the production of and experimentation with droids, by 5. Computers is a class skill for you, though if it is a class skill from the class you take at 1st level, you instead gain a +1 bonus to Computers checks. In addition, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to Intelligence at character creation.

### Body Euphoria (6th Level)
Your efforts to differentiate yourself from your original manufacture have led to a greater understanding of your systems' limits. Once per day as a full action, you can overclock one of your augmentations to regain a number of Stamina Points equal to the augmentation’s item level; you must have an augmentation installed in your body to use this ability.

### Spark of Life (12th Level)
The process of a droid attaining sapience is slow and incremental, but you've learned programming tricks to grant a moment of self-reflection to even the most simple of digitized entities. You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a full action to perform a special hack on a computer or droid for which you have access, against the normal DC for that unsecured access. On a success, you install a generic module that allows self-analysis and self-modification. The system is treated as a sapient creature with a base attitude of indifferent, although the GM may modify this to fit the circumstances. The nature of the sapience granted cannibalizes the program over the course of 1 minute, after which the system returns to its previous state. The newfound intelligence is temporary, however repeated applications can massively speed up the time until such a system naturally develops full sapience of its own.

### Lean on Your Network (18th Level)
Many droids don’t have the luxury of a home world, and must forge a new life for themselves. While at times you find yourself longing for the basic rights and easy stability that others have, your adopted home and family groups bring you a sense of comfort and community that bolsters you and gives you a reason to fight on. Select a home world for your PC. Up to twice per day, when you spend 10 minutes contemplating the positive aspects of your newfound home, you recover 1 Resolve Point. This doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. You must stipulate where this new home is when you reach this level; you aren’t able to change this selection once it has been made.
