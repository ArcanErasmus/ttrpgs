anchoring - crit 1d4 rds immobile
called - summon from 100ft as swift
defiant - anti-disarm, stays in hand when KO'd
durable - weapon +hp/saves
+glamered - illusory appearance
ominous - crit 1d4 rds shaken
+trailblazer - ignore environmental impedance
+invigorating - after dropping opponent, 1 turn +10ft speed +3 str-/dex-/con-based checks
stabilizing - better in zero-g

weapon learning subroutine?
