    - The Double Hackbut is closest to what you want, but go up a half size to 4d8 (2d12 = 4d6)

- Regular firearm ammo options
    - Powder + bullet/shot: 11gp
    - Alchemical paper cartridge + bullet/shot: 12gp, fast, +1 misfire
    - Metal cartridge + bullet/shot: 15gp, fast

## Goals
- Operated by Akundol
    - Attach somewhere to operate the reloading and other features
- Cannon arm
    - Not a full siege engine necessarily, maybe like 4d8 damage?
    - Ball ammo: Longer range, single target
    - Grapeshot: Less accurate, cone blast
    - Carry like 5-10 shots of each, with about 2/3 the total number of shots in ammo bags
    - Reload with Akundol's action
- Versatile secondary arm ideas
    - Big shield (could set as tower shield for cover)
    - Wands or other magic items
    - Just a big ole hammer


# I want a boat
- An airship really, but boy howdy are those expensive

## Base vessel
- Keelboat, 3000gp
    - 100 soldiers or 50 tons cargo
    - 75 ft long, 20 ft wide, crew of 8-15
- Something smaller than a keelboat?
    - Oceangoing concerns
- Flight
    - Bind elementals?
        - See Eberron conversions
    - *Levitate*?
        - Cheapest flight spell, but would require a source of propulsion
            - *Gust of wind* or similar (through some permanent source)?
    - *Overland flight*?

# I want a demiplane

    - The real cost is to *permanency* the casting
- Desired features
    - Mild good and law alignments
    - Mild positive energy dominance
    - Bountiful
    - Earth-dominant? this would be in accordance with Torag, but unusable if it actually removes all the air
    - Looping shape? RING!!!
    - Giant circular forge-temple in the center
    - Morphic?
    - Portal to Material Plane
    - Different flow of time?
    - Enhance transmutation?
