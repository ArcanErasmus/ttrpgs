- Regular firearm ammo options
    - Powder + bullet/shot: 11gp
    - Alchemical paper cartridge + bullet/shot: 12gp, fast, +1 misfire
    - Metal cartridge + bullet/shot: 15gp, fast

## Goals
- Operated by Akundol
    - Attach somewhere to operate the reloading and other features
- Cannon arm
    - Not a full siege engine necessarily, maybe like 4d8 damage?
    - Ball ammo: Longer range, single target
    - Grapeshot: Less accurate, cone blast
    - Carry like 5-10 shots of each, with about 2/3 the total number of shots in ammo bags
    - Reload with Akundol's action
- Versatile secondary arm ideas
    - Big shield (could set as tower shield for cover)
    - Wands or other magic items
    - Just a big ole hammer

    - *Levitate*?
        - Cheapest flight spell, but would require a source of propulsion
            - *Gust of wind* or similar (through some permanent source)?
    - *Overland flight*?

    - Portal to Material Plane
    - Different flow of time?
