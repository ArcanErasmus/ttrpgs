# Mezshmek's Class Features
## Artificer
### Infusions
- Not spells but similar to spontaneous Int spellcaster
    - Regain after 8 hrs rest, 15 mins concentration
    - Subject to Concentration checks similar to spells
    - Can apply metamagic feats similar to sorcerers
    - Infusions identified with Spellcraft like spells
- Automatically know all infusions on list up to castable lvl
    - List: https://sites.google.com/site/eberronpathfinder/conversion-info/magic/spells-and-powers-by-class/artificer
    - Can learn rare or otherwise not on list infusions with 8 hrs study and Spellcraft DC 20 + infusion lvl
    - Cannot reverse engineer spells/powers into infusions
- Infusions have components, but do not suffer ASFC except from heavy armor and tower shields
- No infusion qualifies for spells when making or activating magic items, even if functionally identical
- Infusions do not target creatures, but items (including worn/wielded items)
    - Thus they follow the item, not the creature
    - Must be cast on slot-relevant item

### Artificer's Knowledge
- Count as both caster and manifester for creation magic/psionic items
    - Can create spell/power trigger/completion items without ability to cast/manifest necessary spells/powers
- Instead of needing spells/powers, need "working knowledge" of them
    - Working knowledge comes from Knowledge skill, keying (Arcana) to arcane, (Religion) to divine, (Planes) to occult, and (Psionics) to psionics
    - 1 rank gives 0th lvl effects, each additional 2 ranks in that skill gives another lvl
    - Search 9-lvl caster lists first, then 6-lvl, then 4-lvl, then any others, to determine access lvl
    - Arcane/divine/psionic status of effect is based on donor list
- If need effect not granted from working knowledge, can attempt to duplicate with UMD DC 20 + twice effect lvl
    - Success is required if spell/power is required, otherwise just lowers DC from not having to emulate during crafting
- Can substitute other requirements as normal, but not caster/manifester lvl (which is artificer lvl)
