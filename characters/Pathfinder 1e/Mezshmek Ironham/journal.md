## Custom Items
### Lantern of Sekolah
- Aura: strong transmutation & moderate evil
- CL: 13
- Slot: none
- Weight: 5 lbs
- Price: 55,515 gp
- Description: A staff made of warped and twisted wood with a rusty iron cage hanging from its head.
    - Control Weather (8 charges)
    - Summon Monster VI (2 charges)
    - Call Lightning Storm (1 charge)
    - Lightning Bolt (1 charge)
The charges of this staff can be replenished by cutting out the heart of CG creature with 10+ HD, and placing it in the Iron Cage, whereupon the heart continues to beat and glows bright red. The creature will remain alive until all charges from the staff are spent. For every charge used, the creature takes one negative level. When all the charges are used, the heart ceases to beat and the creature dies. Creatures slain in this way can only be returned to life by a *miracle* or *wish* spell.
Cursed: Anyone attempting to use the staff must pass a Will save versus a DC of 17 + the level of the spell being used or have their alignment shifted one step towards Lawful Evil. Anyone who replenishes the staff via sacrifice has their alignment shifted immediately to Lawful Evil with no save allowed. Anyone touching the staff must make a DC 10 save or be converted to worship of Sekolah, passing the save renders the wielder immune to this conversion ability for 24 hours.

### Forgefather's Hammer
- Aura: moderate transmutation
- CL: 10
- Slot: none
- Weight: 1.5 lbs
- Price: 8,380 gp
- Description: This adamantine blacksmith’s hammer bears designs of Torag’s holy symbol on the head, with a smooth but finely shaped darkwood handle; it is not designed for combat, but the bearer can use it as a Medium light hammer. The owner gains a +4 competence bonus on all Craft skill checks with which they are trained, as the hammer imparts divine knowledge on them. Additionally, the owner may press or strike the hammer against a surface to inscribe a symbol on it, as the spell *arcane mark*. If Torag is the owner’s patron, once per week the owner can strike the hammer on an object or construct to cast *greater make whole* on it.
- Requirements: Craft Wondrous Item, *arcane mark*, *crafter's fortune*, *make whole, greater*
- Cost: 4,440 gp (including 500 gp in adamantine and darkwood)

### Clasp, Gish
- Aura: faint transmutation
- CL: 1
- Slot: none
- Weight: -
- Price: 8,000 gp
- Description: This cobalt clasp is inscribed with arcane runes. It can be attached to (or removed from) the grip, pommel, or other suitable location on a weapon as a standard action. While the clasp is affixed, the wielder can, as a standard action, cause part of the attached weapon to briefly and harmlessly peel open, just long enough for a single wand to be inserted or removed. In this way, the attached weapon functions as if continually under the effect of a *weaponwand* spell. Should the attached weapon be destroyed, the contained wand (if any) is also destroyed, but the clasp falls away unharmed. However, if the clasp itself is destroyed or has its magic suppressed while the weapon contains a wand, the wand is ejected as if at the end of a *weaponwand* spell. Identifying an attached clasp reveals its function as normal, but not whether a wand is contained in the associated weapon.
- Requirements: Craft Wondrous Item, *weaponwand*
- Cost: 4,000 gp

### Glove, Reach
- Aura: faint transmutation
- CL: 1
- Slot: hands
- Weight: -
- Price: 4,000 gp
- Description: These stretchy black gloves cover the hands and forearms. Their effect can be activated as a standard action, provided both are worn. When active, the wearer's arms grow in length, giving them extra reach as the *long arm* spell.
- Requirements: Craft Wondrous Item, *long arm*
- Cost: 2,000 gp

### Mistwing Shroud
- Aura: faint conjuration
- CL: 3
- Slot: shoulders
- Weight: 1 lb
- Price: 8,800 gp
- Description: Cool, damp mist emanates from this white-hooded, floor length cloak, yet it protects the wearer from this mist and from rain. The wearer gains a +5 bonus on Stealth checks in fog, mist, or rain. During these conditions, if the wearer stands still, they can use the Stealth skill even if being observed. Additionally, if the wearer does not move from their position in a round, and is not subject to more than mild winds, the mists wrap around them, providing concealment at the end of their turn that lasts until they move. Lastly, three times a day, if the wearer falls more than 5 feet they can spend an immediate action to gain the benefits of *feather fall*.
- Requirements: Craft Wondrous Item, *create water*, *feather fall*, *obscuring mist*
- Cost: 4,400 gp
