# Mezshmek's Infusion Book - 1st Level
### Ablative Armor - abjuration
| Casting    | 1 rd
| Components | S,M (a scrap of metal from a forge)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | suit of armor touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
The touched suit of armor provides damage reduction of (5 + caster level)/- against the next attack that deals damage to the wearer where damage reduction would apply, to a maximum of 15/-. Once this damage reduction is applied, it fades, even if the amount of damage does not exceed the damage reduction. In order to count as armor, the suit touched must provide an non-magical armor bonus to AC of at least +1.

### Abundant Ammunition - conjuration [summoning]
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a single piece of ammo)
| Target     | one container touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
When cast on a container such as a quiver or a pouch that contains nonmagical ammunition or shuriken (including masterwork ammunition or shuriken, but not special materials, alchemical attributes, or nonmagical treatments on the ammunition) at the start of each round this infusion replaces any ammunition taken from the container the round before. The ammunition taken from the container the round before vanishes. If, after casting this infusion, you cast a spell/infusion that enhances projectiles, such as *align weapon* or *greater magic weapon*, on the same container, all projectiles this infusion conjures are affected by that spell/infusion.

### Alchemical Tinkering - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | firearm or alchemical item touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Fort neg (object)
| SR         | yes
You transform one alchemical item or firearm into another alchemical item or firearm of the same or lesser cost. Magic Items are unaffected by this infusion. At the end of the infusion's duration, alchemical items used while transformed are destroyed and do not return to a usable state and firearms transformed revert back to their original type.

### Alter Musical Instrument - illusion (figment)
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (an instrument)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one musical instrument
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl (D)
| Save       | Fort neg (object)
| SR         | yes (obj)
You alter an instrument so it sounds like a different kind of instrument you are familiar with. The change could be minor (such as making a lute sound like a guitar) or major (making a keyboard sound like drums). All other aspects of the instrument—such as volume, pitch, and how it is played—are unchanged. For example, a piccolo made to sound like an organ is no louder than a normal piccolo, can produce only high notes in the piccolo range, and is a wind instrument.

### Ant Haul - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a small pulley)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 2 hrs/lvl
| Save       | Fort neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The target's carrying capacity triples. This does not affect the creature's actual Strength in any way, merely the amount of material it can carry while benefiting from this infusion. It also has no effect on encumbrance due to armor. If the creature wears armor it still takes the normal penalties for doing so regardless of how much weight the infusion allows it to carry.

### Armor Enchantment, Lesser - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 rd
| Components | V,S,M (a prepared ointment costing 10 gp)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | armor or shield touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This infusion allows you to select any combination of armor or shield special abilities at the time of casting, whose total market price is equal to or less than 3,500 gp, and apply it temporarily to a touched piece of armor or shield. The piece of armor or shield does not need to be enchanted, or even masterwork, for this temporary bonus to apply. For the purposes of this infusion, regular clothing counts as light armor with an Armor Class of 0 with no maximum Dexterity, Armor check penalty, weight, spell failure chance or reduction in movement. When determining the cost of these temporary special abilities, use only the gp value of the bonuses they are worth, not including the cost of any other enhancement bonuses the armor or shield might already have.

This infusion does not provide a enhancement bonus to Armor Class, unless it is detailed in the selected special abilities, nor does it change the material type or apply or remove any special conditions (broken, fragile, etc) to the armor or shield, unless specified otherwise in the chosen special abilities. Likewise, this infusion cannot mimic specific magic armor or shields, like *Mistmail* or a *Fortress Shield*. The special abilities chosen for this infusion must be valid armor or shield enchantment for the target equipment. For example, you cannot place *glamoured* on a shield as there is no equivalent special ability for shields, nor can you place *bashing* on a piece of armor. If a special quality requires a minimum enhancement bonus, the targeted piece of equipment must already have that enhancement bonus to be a valid target.

This temporary enchantment can be dispelled via *dispel magic* or similar effects, instead of the normal suppression of magical items. Likewise, a successful Spellcraft check to identify a spell will tell that this is a temporary infusion. In all other ways, treat the targeted piece of a equipment as a normally enchanted with the chosen special ability for the duration of the infusion. These special qualities stack with any other special qualities the armor or shield might already have.

### Blade Lash - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | your melee weapon
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
Your weapon elongates and becomes whip-like. As part of casting this infusion, you can use this weapon to attempt a trip combat maneuver against one creature within 20 feet, and you gain a +10 bonus on your roll, after which the weapon returns to its previous form.

### Break - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a twig)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one Medium or smaller object
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Fort neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
You can attempt to break or at least damage any one Medium or smaller object within range. If the target fails its Fortitude Saving Throw, it gains the broken condition. If cast on a broken item, that item is destroyed on a failed save.

### Crafter's Curse - transmutation [curse]
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a broken tool)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | 1 day/lvl (D)
| Save       | Will neg
| SR         | yes
The target of crafter's curse takes a -5 penalty on all Craft skill checks while the infusion lasts.

### Crafter's Fortune - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (a tool)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | 1 day/lvl or until discharged (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
The target is struck by inspiration and gains a +5 luck bonus on its next Craft skill check.

### Damp Powder - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a damp piece of cotton)
| Range      | close
| Target     | one loaded firearm
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
This infusion causes ammunition already loaded into the target firearm is ruined with moisture. Any attempt to fire that ammunition fails, with no chance for misfire, and the user must then take a full-round action to clear the weapon before reloading and firing it. If aware of this infusion's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.

### Dancing Lantern - transmutation [fire, light]
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (a lantern)
| Range      | touch
| Effect     | animates one lantern
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You can animate a lantern and order it to follow you. The lantern floats at shoulder height and remains within 5 feet of you, no matter how fast you move. The lantern cannot support any additional weight. The lantern illuminates its normal area, even if it does not have any oil in it. For the purposes of spells or effects targeting it the lantern always acts as if in your possession even when not directly on your person.

A *dancing lantern* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell (CL 9th, 2,500 gp).

### Disguise Weapon - illusion (glamer)
| Casting    | 1 rd
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | manufactured weapon touched
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You make one manufactured weapon look like a different manufactured weapon of the same size and relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed). For example, you could make a Small greatsword look like a Small quarterstaff, a Medium club, or a Large dagger. Even the appearance of an improvised weapon is possible. The extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or make the item look like it is composed of different materials (stone, wood, adamantine, and so on). The infusion does not provide any of the abilities of the chosen form, nor does it alter the perceived tactile or audible properties of the item or how it is wielded. A creature that interacts with the glamer may attempt a Will save to recognize it as an illusion.

### Energy Alteration - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 rd
| Components | S,M (a special ointment representing all five energy types worth 50 gp)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | magic item touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none or Will neg (object)
| SR         | no
You alter a magical item that employs an energy type or grants protection from an energy type, to employ or protect against a different energy type. For example, you could change a *+2 flaming burst longsword* into a *+2 shocking burst longsword* or a *ring of energy resistance (acid)* to a *ring of energy resistance (electricity)*. Only the five core energy types (acid, cold, electricity, fire and sonic) can be chosen for this alteration and all other effects remain the same.

The wielder of a targeted magical item is allowed a Will save to negate this change, if so desired.

### Enhancement Alteration - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | magic shield or weapon touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none or Will neg
| SR         | yes
By touching a magic shield or weapon, you transform some or all of its enhancement bonus to apply to the opposite intended form. If used on a magic shield, some or all (your choice) of its enhancement bonus to AC now applies to attacks made as part of a shield bash, stacking with any preexisting bonuses to shield bashing. If used on a magic weapon, some or all (your choice) of its enhancement bonus to attacks and damage now applies to AC when used to fight defensively, use a total defense action or any other method in which a weapon provides a bonus to AC, stacking with any such pre-existing qualities. Once the amount of the enhancement bonus to be shifted has been determined, it cannot be changed.

The bonus in question always remains an enhancement bonus to either attack and damage (if it's a shield used as a weapon) or to the shield bonus to AC (if its a weapon used a shield). No special qualities, if any, gets shifted. If used on an opponent, a Will save negates the effect.

### Expeditious Excavation - transmutation [earth]
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a tiny shovel)
| Range      | close
| Area       | dirt in a 5-ft cube
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | see text
| SR         | no
You can excavate and move earth, dust, and sand up to the size of a 5-foot cube. If you are buried, you may open a 5-foot cube around yourself, but the infusion cannot be used for tunneling.

Besides its mundane applications, you can open a 5-foot-deep pit at a creature's feet. A Medium or smaller creature falls prone in the pit unless it succeeds on a Reflex save. With a successful save, it can choose to land harmlessly on its feet in the pit or hop to an adjacent square; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature can escape a 5-foot-deep pit with a DC 5 Climb check. Larger creatures may ignore pits smaller than their size.

The earth excavated by this infusion is ordinarily distributed harmlessly across the infusion's range, but you may choose to throw up a burst of grit and debris when you dig a pit. This cloud of debris provides concealment to any creatures in the square affected and all adjacent squares for 1 round. Expeditious excavation has no effect on solid rock or earth creatures.

### Fabricate Bullets - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 rd
| Components | V,S,M (one pound of lead or other soft metal worth 2gp)
| Range      | touch
| Area       | one pound of soft metal
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You convert 1 pound of lead into bullets. When you cast this infusion, you decide whether you create normal sling bullets, firearm bullets, or firearm pellets. The infusion creates two sling bullets, 30 firearm bullets, or 10 uses of pellets.

### Glue Seal - conjuration (creation)
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Area       | one object or one 5-ft square
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | see text
| SR         | no
You cover a solid surface with a layer of sticky glue. Anyone in the area when the infusion is cast must attempt a Reflex save. Those who fail become entangled, but can break free by succeeding at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as a standard action against the DC of this infusion. The area of the infusion is considered difficult terrain. A creature moving through the glue must succeed at a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as part of its move action (DC = the infusion's DC). Creatures that fail lose their movement and become entangled in the first square they enter.

The infusion can also be used to create a sticky coating on an item. A creature holding a targeted item can attempt a Reflex saving throw against the infusion's DC. If the initial saving throw succeeds, the item is unaffected. If it fails, the item is stuck in place. If an affected item is connected to another item (such as a sword in a sheath or a cork in a potion bottle), it cannot be separated from the other item unless the creature succeeds at a combat maneuver check or a Strength check as a move action to free it (DC = the infusion's DC). A creature must succeed at saving throw each time it attempts to use the sticky item; otherwise, the item becomes stuck to the creature. Sticky armor or clothing imposes a –10 circumstance penalty on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple attempted by the wearer, as well as to the wearer's CMD to avoid being grappled.

### Gravity Bow - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
*Gravity bow* significantly increases the weight and density of arrows or bolts fired from your bow or crossbow the instant before they strike their target and then return them to normal a few moments later. Any arrow fired from a bow or crossbow you are carrying when the infusion is cast deals damage as if one size larger than it actually is. For instance, an arrow fired from a Medium longbow normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if fired from a gravity bow (see table on this page for associated increase/decrease in damage due to size change). Only you can benefit from this infusion. If anyone else uses your bow to make an attack the arrows deal damage as normal for their size.

### Identify - divination
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (wine stirred with an owl's feather)
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped emanation
| Duration   | 3 rds/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This infusion functions as *detect magic*, except that it gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This infusion does not allow you to identify artifacts.

### Indisputable Possession - conjuration (teleportation)
| Casting    | 1 rd
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | object touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none (see text)
| SR         | no
By casting this infusion on a touched object, you create a link between you and the object. So long as the effect is active, you can summon the object into your hand as an immediate action. The object cannot weigh more than 100 pounds and if the object is being wielded or worn by someone else (as opposed to just carried), they get a Will save to resist the attempt to summon the object. This does not break the link, so you can attempt it again. However, if the effect is dispelled on either you or the object, the link is broken.

### Inflict Light Damage - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | construct touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will half
| SR         | yes (see text)
By succeeding in melee touch attack against a creature of the construct type, you deal 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). The construct gets a Will save for half damage. However, as this infusion is specifically designed to disrupt the workings of all constructs, including golems, if the targeted construct has a special ability to ignore spells and spell-like affects that allow for spell resistance, that special ability specifically does not interfere with or hamper this infusion. Should the construct have normal spell resistance, then the usual caster level check is needed. 

### Jury-Rig - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a pinch of tree resin)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one broken object of up to 2 lbs/lvl
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
When you cast this infusion, a spectral force binds a broken weapon together, relieving the broken condition for a short time. While under the effects of this infusion, an item with the broken condition suffers no adverse effects from that condition, and is treated as if it is not broken. The object regains no hit points, and damage can still destroy the object.

### Knight Unburdened - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | suit of armor touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
In order to cast this infusion, you must target a suit of armor that would normally decrease the movement rate of the wearer. For the infusion's duration, the touched suit of armor does not incur any penalty to the wearer's movement rate. All other qualities and penalties, like Armor Check penalty, of the armor worn still apply normally.

### Lead Blades - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
*Lead blades* increases the momentum and density of your melee weapons just as they strike a foe. All melee weapons you are carrying when the infusion is cast deal damage as if one size category larger than they actually are. For instance, a Medium longsword normally deals 1d8 points of damage, but it would instead deal 2d6 points of damage if benefiting from lead blades (see table below). Only you can benefit from this infusion. If anyone else uses one of your weapons to make an attack it deals damage as normal for its size.

### Longshot - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a piece of fletching)
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
This infusion reduces the effect of range, granting a +10-foot bonus to the range increment of any weapon used by the subject.

### Magic Aura - illusion (glamer)
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (a small square of silk that must be passed over the object that receives the aura)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one touched object weighing up to 5 lbs/lvl
| Duration   | 1 day/lvl (D)
| Save       | none (see text)
| SR         | no
You alter an item's aura so that it registers to *detect* spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were non-magical, or a magic item of a kind you specify, or the subject of a spell you specify. If the object bearing *magic aura* has *identify* cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner recognizes that the aura is false and detects the object's actual qualities if he succeeds on a Will save. Otherwise, he believes the aura and no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.

If the targeted item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance), *magic aura* doesn't work.

Note: A magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor must be a masterwork item, so a sword of average make, for example, looks suspicious if it has a magical aura.

### Magic Stone - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | touch
| Target     | up to three pebbles touched
| Duration   | 30 mins or until discharged
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
You transmute as many as three pebbles, which can be no larger than sling bullets, so that they strike with great force when thrown or slung. If hurled, they have a range increment of 20 feet. If slung, treat them as sling bullets (range increment 50 feet). The infusion gives them a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. The user of the stones makes a normal ranged attack. Each stone that hits deals 1d6+1 points of damage (including the infusion's enhancement bonus), or 2d6+2 points against undead.

### Magic Vestment - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | touch
| Target     | armor or shield touched
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
You imbue a suit of armor or a shield with an enhancement bonus of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this infusion.

### Magic Weapon - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | touch
| Target     | armor or shield touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
*Magic weapon* gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.

You can't cast this infusion on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see *magic fang*). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this infusion.

### Mask Dweomer - illusion (glamer)
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a piece of gauze)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature or object touched
| Duration   | 1 day/lvl (D)
| Save       | none (see text)
| SR         | no
You mask and manipulate a spell's magic aura to make it harder to detect. Select one spell effect on the target creature or object. You must have either cast this spell yourself or have perceived it by means of *detect magic* or *arcane sight*.

Both the desired spell effect and *mask dweomer* are hidden from *detect magic*, although more powerful spells (such as *arcane sight*) pierce the deception if the caster succeeds on a Will save. *Analyze dweomer* automatically detects both *mask dweomer* and any masked spell effects.

### Mirror Polish - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a soft cloth)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one metal item of up to 1 sq ft
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
You polish a metal item until it is reflective enough to be used as a mirror. This does not prevent the item from later damage or corrosion that would ruin the mirrored surface. The infusion can be cast only on a metal item with a fairly smooth and contiguous surface, such as a breastplate, a helm, a shield, or a sword, but not a mace, chainmail, or scale mail.

Note: In all references, the spell lists the save as "yes (object)"

### Peacebond - abjuration
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one sheathed or slung weapon
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (object)
| SR         | yes (object)
You lock a weapon in place on its owner's body, or within the weapon's sheath or holster. Anyone who then tries to draw the weapon must spend a standard action and succeed at a Strength check (DC equal to the saving throw DC) to do so, provoking attacks of opportunity whether the attempt succeeds or fails.

### Pending Potion - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 min
| Components | S,M (the potion to be consumed)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | potion touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
By refocusing how the energy of a potion is released, the caster makes a potion usable after it is drunk, delaying the desired effect. The person who drinks the potion can, with an immediate action, activate the consumed potion. Only one potion can be stored within a single person. When the effect is activated, it must still be a valid target or the potion fails and, if the potion is not activated before the duration ends, the effect and the potion are wasted.

### Refine Improvised Weapon - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one improvised weapon
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
You transform an improvised weapon into an equivalent simple or martial weapon of masterwork quality. This effect does not alter the weapon's shape or appearance in any way. For example, if this infusion is cast on a chair leg, a butter knife, or a pitchfork, the items function as a masterwork club, a masterwork dagger, or a masterwork trident, respectively, but the items look no different than they did before the infusion was cast.

### Reinforce Armaments - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a metal pin)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | armor suit or weapon touched
| Duration   | 10 mins/lvl
| Save       | Will neg (harmless, object)
| SR         | yes (harmless, object)
You reinforce a weapon or armor suit to give it a temporarily upgrade or mitigate the fragile quality. A suit of armor or weapon touched that has the fragile quality is not considered to have the fragile quality for the infusion's duration. Normal armor suits or weapons subjected to this infusion instead gain the masterwork quality for the infusion's duration and their hardness is doubled. If this infusion is cast on masterwork or magical armor or weapons, their hardness is doubled for the duration of the infusion.

### Repair Light Damage - transmutation
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | construct touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will (harmless)
| SR         | yes (see text)
If the touched construct is not destroyed or dead, you repair 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). However, as this infusion is specifically designed to repair the workings of all constructs, including golems, if the targeted construct has a special ability to ignore spells and spell-like affects that allow for spell resistance, that special ability specifically does not interfere with or hamper this infusion. Should the construct have normal spell resistance, then the usual caster level check is needed.

### Resistance Item - abjuration
| Casting    | 1 rd

An item you touch is enchanted to provide whomever wields or wears it a circumstance bonus to one specific type of skill check, chosen at the time of casting. This item does not change the rules concerning skill checks, thus it cannot allow a Knowledge check if you have no ranks in that Knowledge, nor can it change the type of action involved. The bonus given starts at +2 and increases by 1 for every two caster levels beyond first (+3 at 3rd, +4 at 5th, +5 at 7th, etc).

Ammunition in the target firearm generates less of an explosive charge when fired. With such ammunition, the firearm's range increment is halved and the firer takes a –2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this infusion's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 Spellcraft check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.

This infusion allows you to select any combination of weapon special abilities at the time of casting, whose total market price is equal to or less than 7,500 gp and apply it temporarily to a touched weapon. The weapon does not need to be enchanted, or even masterwork, for these temporary bonuses to apply. When determining the cost of these temporary special abilities, use only the gp value of the bonuses they are worth, not including the cost of any other enhancement bonuses the weapon might already have. Likewise, special qualities that need to be applied to each end of a double-ended weapon are applied separately.

For example, a single casting this infusion is enough to place *flaming* on a light crossbow, a +1 bonus worth 2,000 gp, with 5,500 gp to spare. It could also apply *flaming* on one end of a double-ended weapon and *frost* to the other, which would be 2 +1 bonuses worth a total of 4,000 gp. It then could also apply a flat gp bonus special quality, like *impervious*, which is worth 3,000 gp. It could not, however, also apply a +2 bonus to a weapon, as that would cost 8,000 gp.

This infusion does not provide an enhancement bonus to attack or damage, unless it is detailed in a selected special ability, nor does it change the material type or apply or remove any special conditions (broken, fragile, etc) to the weapon, unless it is detailed otherwise in a selected special ability. Likewise, this infusion cannot mimic specific magic weapons, like an *javelin of lightning*. All special abilities chosen for this infusion must be valid enchantments for the target equipment. For example, you cannot place *keen* on a club, nor can you place *ki focus* on a bow. If a special quality requires a minimum enhancement bonus, the targeted piece of equipment must already have that enhancement bonus to be a valid target.

This temporary enchantment can be dispelled via *dispel magic* or similar effects, instead of the normal suppression of magical items. Likewise, a successful Spellcraft check to identify a spell will tell that this is a temporary infusion. In all other ways, treat the targeted piece of a equipment as normally enchanted with the chosen special ability for the duration of the infusion. Because this infusion must be cast on a weapon, it cannot be applied to natural weapons, including unarmed strikes. Likewise, it only has these special abilities while wielded by the caster, losing the abilities the instant the artificer is no longer wielding it, and regaining them the moment it is returned. These special qualities are in addition to, and stack with, any other special qualities the weapon might have.
