### feats
- Half-Swording Style https://www.d20pfsrd.com/extras/community-creations/black-flame-studios-lab/feats/half-swording-style
**Half-Swording Style**
*You learn to grab the blade of your sword when needed, to exploit the weaknesses of heavy armor.*
- Prerequisite: Weapon Focus (Longsword, Bastard Sword, or Greatsword) or Combat Expertise, Base Attack Bonus +1
- Benefit: The sword being wielded can be used in two special forms of attack. Both styles require the sword to be held in two hands, but you mayonly apply half your strength to damage, the sword's damage is reduced by one step (for example, a Medium longsword would deal 1d6 damage). You may only choose which form of attack to use at the start of your turn, and it lasts until the start of your next turn. Choosing to use one of these special styles imposes a -2 penalty to AC against melee attacks, as it makes parrying more difficult. Gripping the blade of your sword does not subject you to any extra effects from your own weapon, such as a *flaming* enchantment.
    - *Half-Sword Thrust*: By gripping the blade with your off-hand, you can aim for the gaps in a suit of armor. With this style, the sword does piercing damage, and you treat your opponent's armor bonus to AC as lower by 1 point + 1 point per four levels above first (maximum 5 at level 17), to a minimum of +0. If your opponent has no armor bonus to AC, you may apply this reduction to their natural armor bonus instead.
    - *Mordhau*: By flipping the sword around and gripping the blade with both hands, you can strike with the crossguard or pommel, dealing a resounding blow even through the heaviest of helmets. With this style, the sword deals bludgeoning damage, and a successful strike forces your opponent to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 userâ€™s level + Strength modifier), or they are staggered until the start of your next turn. If a creature is immune to extra damage from critical hits, it is not subject to this effect.
- Special: This technique is intended for western swords like the longsword, bastard sword, or greatsword. Other weapons may be used with this feat at GM's discretion. Additionally, if Weapon Focus is used as the prerequisite, you can still use any applicable weapon, not just the one you chose with Weapon Focus.

### items
- Wondrous Items and enchantments https://www.d20pfsrd.com/extras/community-creations/house-rules/wondrous-items
    - Brilliant: Needs restrictions on auto-dispel, maybe by effect level or frequency of use. Faint evocation.
    - Featherweight: I really like mithral-as-enchant, lets you use other skymetals instead and still get its bonuses. Clever to not double-count mwk reduction to ACP. Faint transmutation.
    - Fiery: Needs less awkward wording, but solid (like "5x/day activate for 1 minute", "striking the wearer with melee/natural wpns"). Moderate evocation.
    - Healing: Also awkward wording, but good. Is +4 a good spot for it? Moderate conjuration.
    - Mighty Bulwark: Doesn't indicate rules for choosing a direction to face, ambiguity on awkward wording of ASFC note. Moderate abjuration.
    - Staff of Shadows: Solid, but please follow staff description format. Moderate illusion.
    - Everfull Component Pouch: Solid, maybe add Eschew Materials feat to prereqs, as it duplicates that effect. Minor divination.
    - Handy Scroll Tube: "For all purposes" line is awkward, otherwise great. Moderate divination.
    - Handy Wand Case: Consider that this item reverses the specific decision to not allow Quick Draw for wands, and for only 2k. Also, a spell to call an item might be more appropriate than *unseen servant*. Minor creation.
    - Bottomless Money Pouch: Good for ignoring coin weights. -10 is too high for the price. Moderate conjuration.
    - Quiver of Arrow Creation: A consumable that's not overpriced!? Is this even pathfinder??? Moderate transmutation.
    - Quiver of Endless Arrows: Masterwork is a nice touch while still being totally balanced. Clearly defined rules. Moderate conjuration.
    - Vest of Storing: Useful and clearly defined. Moderate transmutation.
    - Ring Bracelet: There is no such thing as "one" arm or hand slot, nor "bracer" or "glove" slots. But, a creative way to mess with magic item slots. Half cost for an item might still be unbalanced, and is absolutely ripe for powergaming at lower levels. At least requiring Forge Ring will prevent low-level abuse of crafting with it.
        - Shadowguard Ring Bracers: Minor illusion.
        - Handflower of Grace: Replace *charm monster* with *eagle's splendor*. Moderate transmutation.
        - Ring Bracers of Shielding: Devalues *Ring of Protection*, scales cost way too slowly. Absolutely not allowed. Moderate abjuration, I guess.
        - Figment Weavers: At-will usage but different action is interesting. Minor illusion.
    - Shoes of Agility: Should be 5000gp, not 2500. Could be more creative with spell requirement. Minor transmutation.
