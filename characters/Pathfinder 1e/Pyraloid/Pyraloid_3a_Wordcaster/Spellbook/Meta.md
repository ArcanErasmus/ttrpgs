# Pyraloid's Spellbook - Meta Words

## 0th Lvl
### Boost
This meta word allows an effect or target word to use its boosted description. Some boosted descriptions increase the level of the effect word or target word, and can only be used if the wordspell is of a high enough level to accommodate the new level. If a word has more than one boosted description, the caster can choose which to use (but never more than one per word). This meta word can be applied to a spell multiple timesâ€”once to the target word and once for each effect word.

### Distant
This word increases a wordspell's range, as determined by its target word. If the word has a Close range, it increases to Medium. If the word has a Medium range, it increases to Long. This word has no effect on target words with a range other than Close or Medium.

### Flexible
This modifies a single effect word to allow it to use any target type, regardless of target restrictions.
If using a Cone target, increase the level of the effect word by 1.
If using a Burst or Line target, increase the level of the effect word by 2.
If using a Barrier target, increase the level of the effect word by 3.

### Lengthy
A wordspell with this meta word doubles its duration. This meta word has no affect on effect words with a duration of instantaneous. The effect of this word does not stack with the effect of the Extend Spell feat.

### Careful
A wordspell with this meta word does not require a somatic component.

### Easily Cast
This metaword allows the wordspell to be cast more easily in difficult situations. When casting defensively, you must make a concentration check (DC 10 + double the level of the spell you're casting) to successfully cast the wordspell. This metaword can modify a target word or an effect word.

### Object
This metaword alters the saving throw, making it affect objects, such as undead and constructs. If the wordspell requires a Fortitude save, this metaword allows it to affect objects. This change does not affect whether or not a successful save negates the effect, reduces it, or has some other effect; it simply alters the types of creatures that can be affected by it. This has no effect on wordspells that require a Reflex or Will save.

### Quiet
A wordspell with this meta word does not require a verbal component. This meta word can modify a target word or an effect word.

### Simple
A wordspell with this meta word does not require a material component. This meta word can modify a target word or an effect word.
