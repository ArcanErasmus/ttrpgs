## Backstory
- child of archivists: parents focused on library-building
    - Corcyra and Papilion
    - settled in current city as minor trading hub, affordable property, less competition
    - collecting documents, museum-pieces, even some scrolls and the like
    - purchase from travelling merchants, 
    - access to research materials for a fee, rent/sell items
- cooperation with thieves guild:
    - at first, they had some friction, with the guild extorting some "fire insurance" money
    - paying for "protection" quickly turned into paying for *actual* protection, to secure the valuable collection
    - as they became more friendly with the guild, more guild members began paying for collection access themselves, for intel gathering
    - covertly, parents began expanding their intel collection, often hiring guild members to procure items or to keep them abreast of rumors and movements
- where do i come in?
    - grew up with magic training, reading from tons of random works
    - started helping guild more directly: translations, intel, go with them to locate important works
    - more daring missions: negotiations, even some thefts and fights (not always exactly pre-approved by parents)
    - worked with Jass on several occasions
