| Target     | up to 5 creatures, no 2 more than 15 ft apart

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can't be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile â€“ two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

## Old Entries - 1st lvl
### Abundant Ammunition - conjuration [summoning]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M/DF (a single piece of ammo)
| Target     | one container touched
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
When cast on a container such as a quiver or a pouch that contains nonmagical ammunition or shuriken (including masterwork ammunition or shuriken, but not special materials, alchemical attributes, or nonmagical treatments on the ammunition) at the start of each round this spell replaces any ammunition taken from the container the round before. The ammunition taken from the container the round before vanishes. If, after casting this spell, you cast a spell that enhances projectiles, such as *align weapon* or *greater magic weapon*, on the same container, all projectiles this spell conjures are affected by that spell.

### Dancing Darkness - evocation [darkness, shadow]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | medium
| Effect     | Up to 4 spheres, all within a 10 ft radius area
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You create either up to four spheres of darkness that each reduce the illumination level by one step within a 20-foot-radius, or one dimly lit, vaguely humanoid shape. Each sphere must stay within a 10-foot-radius area of one another but can otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like.

The darkness can move up to 100 feet per round. The effect winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell's range.

This spell can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

### Expeditious Retreat - transmutation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).

### Snowball - conjuration (creation) [cold, water]

| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close

| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Fort partial (see text)
| SR         | no
You conjure a ball of packed ice and snow that you can throw at a single target as a ranged touch attack. The snowball deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 5d6) on a successful hit, and the target must make a successful Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round.

### Vanish - illusion (glamer)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
