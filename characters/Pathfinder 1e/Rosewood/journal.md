# Rosewood's Journal
## Backstory
- In a remote (and magically unstable) coastal marsh was born a very large Girran. This Girran grew even larger very quickly, and was thus named Six Hardy Rosewoods Entwined and Kneeling, or "Rosewood" for short. Rosewood was raised in a time of relative plenty, and even had occasional contact with traders, explorers, and hunters of other races who dared to brave the beasts of the marshland. Rosewood, within a mere two decades, towered over the other Girrans. While not laying claim to the sharpest intellect, Rosewood certainly had the mightiest horns, not to mention the claws that would manifest at a moment's notice through latent psionic talent. These traits led Rosewood to excell at a very *direct* style of hunting or fishing, which observers might instead call "wrestling" or "brawling".
- But Rosewood's life would not be so simple forever. Upon returning from a less successful "stirring of the pot", Rosewood found the tribe in despair. Others, too, had lacked results, and a tension backed by hunger pervaded the settlement. Additionally, several Girran had not returned from their stirrings, normally a rarity, and a cause for much fear among a species with low birth rate and long natural lives. Despite a poor memory of the words, Rosewood was quick to join in the tribe's prayers for bountiful hunts. But the tribe's pleas went unanswered as more Girran returned with empty arms and empty bellies. As more and more of the tribe grew too weak to go back out in search of a meal, desperation set in. With options running out, a few of the oldest Girran took a bold step. Almost at the limit of a Girran's natural lifespan, the elders offered themselves as sacrifices, in hope that this would placate a higher power who could return plenty to the marshes.
- Unfortunately for the tribe, the deity that answered was *not* a benevolent one. It had been directly responsible for the famine, consuming vast amounts of flora and fauna throughout the swamp and surrounding waters. But food was getting harder to find for it too, and its eternal hunger could not be sated. With this tribe of Girrans weakened and making such a loud plea, it saw an opportunity. Fearing a more powerful being would take notice of the Girrans' plight and come drive it out, the hunger deity knew it had to act.
Whether it saw Rosewood as the strongest - or merely the weakest willed - is not certain, but it summoned up all its power and possessed the young Girran. Blinded by an overwhelming magical hunger, and goaded by the deity's urging, Rosewood flew into a ravenous frenzy. The sacrifices had been a success.
- When Rosewood's senses returned, the rest of the tribe had been slain, blood soaking the ground from the unholy feast. Rosewood felt full and very content, but it would be the last time those feelings would grace the cursed Girran. The hunger deity had taken residence in Rosewood, specifically Rosewood's stomach. The marsh had a uniquely weak separation from the nearby collection of demiplanes. And while the hunger deity would normally never travel to such a place devoid of food, it was able to grab hold of one such small plane and connect it to Rosewood's stomach. From there, it had ample elbow room to relax and hop around nearby dimensions, while always in reach of its new pawn.
- The hunger deity did not actually have a strong control over Rosewood, and its possession would certainly not work a second time. But what it did have was the ability to share its eternal hunger, and drive Rosewood to hunt and consume. Always taking just enough of anything eaten, the deity would not let Rosewood feel fullness. And so, Rosewood travels out of the swamp.

## Quest Log
- I will eventually question *why* I am never satisfied. If I ever get an answer, I will then have to figure out how to do something about it. Possible solutions:
    - "Bad" end: Sever my stomach demiplane connection. This would cost me a lot of my Gourmand power, and be a total weakass cop-out.
    - "Good" end: Enter my own stomach dimension (likely with the help of a Bound Bag, or in a similar ritual to the creation of one), and slay the hunger deity. This would free me of its aura of hunger, though I might also need to cleanse its influence from the demiplane.
- Pay for laser-gun-eye from Jaboleth the Aboleth's Eyeball Shoppe
    - Retrieve stolen medusa eye, traced to the hold of a dwarven trading ship
