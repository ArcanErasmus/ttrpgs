### Blade Skills
#### Advanced Talents (can select without covert training)
- The soulknife can select an advanced rogue talent from the following list: Confounding Blades, Crippling Strike, Stealthy Sniper. The soulknife can select this blade skill multiple times. The soulknife must have the Covert Training class feature and be at least 10th level before selecting this blade skill.

#### Animal Senses
- The feral heart's senses sharpen to animal-like levels. She gains low-light vision (if she already possessed this, then she does not gain any visual bonuses), a +2 bonus on Perception checks, and the scent special ability. The soulknife must possess the form claws class feature to select this blade skill.

#### Bite
- The feral heart gains a bite attack as a primary natural attack that deals 1d8 points of damage (if a Medium-sized creature) and is affected by the enhanced claws ability, but the enhancement bonus on it is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and it has the same configuration from enhanced claws. If this would result in the bite having no enhancement bonus and a weapon special ability such as flaming, the bite does not gain any weapon special abilities granted by enhanced claws and is instead only considered to be psionic for the purposes of damage reduction. This bite attack, like most bite attacks, deals bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The feral heart must be at least 6th level in order to select this blade skill.

#### Combat Slide
- Upon successfully striking an enemy in melee, the soulknife may immediately make a 5-foot step (even if she's already moved in the round, but not if she's taken a 5-foot step). In addition, when someone misses the soulknife with a melee attack, she may spend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step.

#### Deadly Blow
- The soulknife's mind blade critical multiplier increases by 1. A soulknife must be at least 10th level to choose this blade skill.

#### Disrupting Strike
- As a full-round action, a soulknife can make one melee attack against each enemy adjacent to her. If she hits, the attack deals no damage, but each enemy hit takes a -5 penalty to all melee and ranged damage rolls until the start of the soulknife's next turn. This blade skill may not be used with the mind bolt.

#### Dueling Blade
- When a soulknife is fighting defensively, or using the Combat Expertise feat, with a mind blade, and an opponent misses her in melee, she may expend her psionic focus to make an attack of opportunity against that opponent with her mind blade. The soulknife ignores the penalty to attack rolls from fighting defensively for this attack.

#### Evasion (can select without covert training)
- The soulknife can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the soulknife is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless soulknife does not gain the benefit of evasion. The soulknife must have the Covert Training class feature to select this blade skill.

#### Extended Strike
- A soulknife may, as a standard action, make a single attack as if her reach was 5' longer. This blade skill may be combined with the twin strike blade skill. A soulknife must be at least 12th level to choose this blade skill.

#### Focused Defense
- When fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise or the total defense action, the soulknife adds her Wisdom modifier as a dodge bonus to her AC so long as she maintains psionic focus. The soulknife must be at least 4th level in order to select this blade skill.

#### Focused Offense
- As long as the soulknife maintains psionic focus, she adds her Wisdom modifier to her attack and damage rolls instead of her Strength modifier.

#### Full Enhancement (for Bite)
- When forming her mind blade into multiple items, the soulknife suffers no reduction in enhancement bonus.

#### Furious Charge
- A soulknife with this ability deals an additional 2 points of damage on every attack made at the end of a charge. The increased damage is only 1 per attack for off-hand attacks, but becomes 3 per attack when using the two-handed form of the mind blade.

#### Gruesome Riposte
- The soulknife may expend her psionic focus as an immediate action to attack an enemy who has successfully struck her in melee. This attack is assumed to happen after the successful attack, so she cannot use this ability if the attack would put her below 0 hit points, nor does dropping her enemy below 0 hit points prevent the attack from hitting. A soulknife must be at least 10th level to choose this blade skill.

#### Improved Enhancement
- The soulknife's enhancement bonus on her mind blade increases by 1. This increase may be used to increase the actual enhancement bonus of the mind blade (to a maximum of +5) or be spent on weapon special abilities, as normal. A soulknife must be at least 12th level to choose this blade skill.

#### Improved Evasion (can select without covert training)
- This works like evasion, except that while the soulknife still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, he henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless soulknife does not gain the benefit of improved evasion. A soulknife must have the Evasion blade skill, the Covert Training class feature, and be at least 10th level before selecting this blade skill.

#### Mark of the Challenger
- The soulknife charges her mind blade with the ability to cause an enemy to focus on her. As a standard action, the soulknife makes a melee attack against a creature. If the attack is successful, the target takes a -2 penalty to attacks made against targets other than the soulknife until the end of its next turn.

#### Pounce
- If the feral heart charges he can still make a full attack at the end of the charge instead of a single attack, although the full attack must be made with only natural attacks. The feral heart must be at least 10th level to select this blade skill.

#### Quick Shift
- The feral heart can form all of his natural attacks as a free action. He can choose to form only some or all of his natural attacks with this ability.

#### Rake
- The feral heart can claw an opponent he is currently grappling in addition to maintaining the grapple. The feral heart cannot use this ability the round he initiates the grapple but can use it if grappled by another or while maintaining the grappled condition. The feral heart must be at least 4th level to select this blade skill.

#### Reaching Blade
- The soulknife may expend her focus to increase her reach with her mind blade by 5 feet until the start of her next turn. Unlike normal reach weapons, a soulknife may also attack adjacent opponents with her mind blade. A soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

#### Rend
- When the feral heart successfully strikes with both claws against a single creature, he can cause additional damage equal to one claw attack plus 1+1/2 his Strength bonus. This blade skill can only be used once per round. The feral heart must be at least 12th level to select this blade skill.

#### Rending Blades
- Hooks extend from the soulknife's mind blade, dealing an additional 1d6 bleed damage on a critical hit, and giving a competence bonus on Climb checks equal to the enhancement bonus of the mind blade.

#### Rogue Talent (can select without covert training)
- The soulknife can select a rogue talent from the following list: Befuddling Strike, Fast Stealth, Slow Reactions, Sniper's Eye, Surprise Attack. The soulknife can select this blade skill multiple times. The soulknife must have the covert training class feature to select this blade skill.

#### Thick Skin
- The feral heart gains a +2 natural armor bonus to his AC.

#### Thick Skin, Improved
- The natural armor bonus gained from thick skin is improved by 1. This blade skill can be taken up to three times; its effects stack.

#### Trade Blows
- When the soulknife uses the total defense action, she may make a melee attack at her normal attack bonus on anyone that makes a melee attack against her, regardless of whether the opponent's attack hits. This attack is resolved immediately after the opponent's attack. The soulknife may make one such attack for each attack made against her. If multiple opponents attack the soulknife, each attack she makes must be against the enemy that triggered it. All such attacks are made with a -4 penalty on the attack roll, and are an exception to the rule that you cannot attack during the total defense action. A soulknife must be at least 10th level to choose this blade skill.

#### Twin Strike
- When making a single standard attack and wielding two mind blades, the soulknife may attack with both of her mind blades at the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting. She may also utilize this ability when making attacks of opportunity, but not for any other special attacks, unless specifically stated otherwise. The soulknife must be at least 8th level to choose this blade skill.

#### Wing Clip
- As a standard action, the soulknife may make a single melee attack against a single creature. If she hits, instead of dealing damage, the vibrations in her mind blade damages the creature's ability to move, rendering it unable to move for a number of rounds equal to the soulknife's Strength modifier (minimum 1). A successful Fortitude save negates the effect. The DC of this save is 10 + the soulknife's base attack bonus.
