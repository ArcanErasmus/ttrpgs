# Rosewood's Journal
## Backstory
- In a remote (and magically unstable) coastal marsh was born a very large Girran. This Girran grew even larger very quickly, and was thus named Six Hardy Rosewoods Entwined and Kneeling, or "Rosewood" for short. Rosewood was raised in a time of relative plenty, and even had occasional contact with traders, explorers, and hunters of other races who dared to brave the beasts of the marshland. Rosewood, within a mere two decades, towered over the other Girrans. While not laying claim to the sharpest intellect, Rosewood certainly had the mightiest horns, not to mention the claws that would manifest at a moment's notice through latent psionic talent. These traits led Rosewood to excell at a very *direct* style of hunting or fishing, which observers might instead call "wrestling" or "brawling".
- But Rosewood's life would not be so simple forever. Upon returning from a less successful "stirring of the pot", Rosewood found the tribe in despair. Others, too, had lacked results, and a tension backed by hunger pervaded the settlement. Additionally, several Girran had not returned from their stirrings, normally a rarity, and a cause for much fear among a species with low birth rate and long natural lives. Despite a poor memory of the words, Rosewood was quick to join in the tribe's prayers for bountiful hunts. But the tribe's pleas went unanswered as more Girran returned with empty arms and empty bellies. As more and more of the tribe grew too weak to go back out in search of a meal, desperation set in. With options running out, a few of the oldest Girran took a bold step. Almost at the limit of a Girran's natural lifespan, the elders offered themselves as sacrifices, in hope that this would placate a higher power who could return plenty to the marshes.
- Unfortunately for the tribe, the deity that answered was *not* a benevolent one. It had been directly responsible for the famine, consuming vast amounts of flora and fauna throughout the swamp and surrounding waters. But food was getting harder to find for it too, and its eternal hunger could not be sated. With this tribe of Girrans weakened and making such a loud plea, it saw an opportunity. Fearing a more powerful being would take notice of the Girrans' plight and come drive it out, the hunger deity knew it had to act.
Whether it saw Rosewood as the strongest - or merely the weakest willed - is not certain, but it summoned up all its power and possessed the young Girran. Blinded by an overwhelming magical hunger, and goaded by the deity's urging, Rosewood flew into a ravenous frenzy. The sacrifices had been a success.
- When Rosewood's senses returned, the rest of the tribe had been slain, blood soaking the ground from the unholy feast. Rosewood felt full and very content, but it would be the last time those feelings would grace the cursed Girran. The hunger deity had taken residence in Rosewood, specifically Rosewood's stomach. The marsh had a uniquely weak separation from the nearby collection of demiplanes. And while the hunger deity would normally never travel to such a place devoid of food, it was able to grab hold of one such small plane and connect it to Rosewood's stomach. From there, it had ample elbow room to relax and hop around nearby dimensions, while always in reach of its new pawn.
- The hunger deity did not actually have a strong control over Rosewood, and its possession would certainly not work a second time. But what it did have was the ability to share its eternal hunger, and drive Rosewood to hunt and consume. Always taking just enough of anything eaten, the deity would not let Rosewood feel fullness. And so, Rosewood travels out of the swamp.

## Quest Log
- TODO: Rework backstory for "Aspect of [Sin]" idea
- I will eventually question *why* I am never satisfied. If I ever get an answer, I will then have to figure out how to do something about it. Possible solutions:
    - "Bad" end: Sever my stomach demiplane connection. This would cost me a lot of my Gourmand power, and be a total weakass cop-out.
    - "Good" end: Enter my own stomach dimension (likely with the help of a Bound Bag, or in a similar ritual to the creation of one), and slay the hunger deity. This would free me of its aura of hunger, though I might also need to cleanse its influence from the demiplane.
- Pay for laser-gun-eye from Jaboleth the Aboleth's Eyeball Shoppe
    - Retrieve stolen medusa eye, traced to the hold of a dwarven trading ship

## Character Descriptions
- Clamshell armor
    - The centerpiece of this *four mirror armor* is made from the shell of a giant clam. From the waist hangs a tunic of layered dark furs, reinforced with jagged ribs cut from crab and lobster shells. Further plating of various shells covers the shoulders, upper arms, and thighs. Thick gloves made of a seaweed-green skin cover the hands, but leave fingertips exposed. Boots of brown, warty hide extend up past the knees, to which turtle shell and shell fragments have been affixed to protect the kneecaps, shins, and feet.

The saving throw against this, if any, is equal to 10 + 1/2 your antipaladin level + your Cha bonus. You must provide material components as normal, or you may choose to suffer 1 temporary negative level plus 1 additional negative level for each 1,000 gold pieces otherwise required for the spell replicated. These negative levels are removed after 24 hours (they never become permanent), and cannot be overcome in any way except by waiting for the duration to expire. You must abide by the wording of their wish; you may, however, choose to creatively interpret a poorly-phrased wish, and you may demand payment of any kind.

## Alternate Class Features
### Detect Evil/Good
- Detect Danger (Ex): You are able to detect danger, granting you a +1 bonus to Initiative checks. Additionally, you never caught flat-footed.

### Aura of Resolve/Aura of Despair
- Aura of Command (Ex): You are easily able to rally others to your cause and coordinate their actions. All of your allies within 10 feet gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases to +2 at 12th level, and +3 at 16th level. This ability functions only while the character is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.

### Aura of Justice/Vengeance
- Appeal Against Authority (Su): Freedom is one of the most important ideals to an errant templar. By spending two uses (at no spell level cost) of his illicit drive, he grants immunity to compulsion effects to himself and all of his allies within 10 feet for one minute. Using this ability is a free action.
- Wicked Tongue (Su): For a knight of avarice, words are far sharper than even the most wicked of blades. You are able to expend two uses (at no spell level cost) of your ransacking blow to levy a powerful curse upon every enemy within 10 feet. Creatures affected by your curse suffer a bleed effect equal to your Charisma modifier that lasts for one minute. This effect cannot be cured by normal means, but can be healed magically. Creatures that are immune to bleed damage instead suffer (your Charisma modifier)d8 points of damage, but may make a DC (10 + ½ your class level + your Charisma modifier) Fortitude save for half damage. Using this ability is a free action.

### Aura of Faith/Sin
- Aura of Bedlam (Su): An errant templar harnesses the energy of pure chaos. As a swift action, the errant templar generates a 10-foot aura of bedlam. This aura disrupts spells and magic items (except those of a chaotic nature) used within the aura. Enemy spellcasters within the aura must make a successful DC (10 + ½ your class level + your Charisma modifier) caster level check each time they attempt to cast a spell. If the check fails, the spell fizzles away just as if it had been cast. Any magic item that your foes use within this area must make a successful DC (10 + ½ your class level + your Charisma modifier) Fortitude save or lose its magical properties for that round. A new save must be made each round the item remains within the area. These DCs are Constitution-based. Spells and powers with the chaotic descriptor are unaffected by the aura of bedlam. This aura lasts for one minute, until the errant templar dismisses it (as a free action), or until it is discharged (see below), whichever comes first. Whenever one of your foes within your aura successfully casts any spell that does not possess the chaotic descriptor, you are able to speak a word of rebuke as an immediate action to make a targeted counterspell effect; on a successful (1d20 + your class level) check versus DC (11 + the spellcaster’s level), the spell ends without effect. This word of rebuke immediately ends the aura of bedlam.
- Aura of Selfishness (Su): The preservation of self comes before all subsequent actions, and no one knows this better than a knight of avarice. As a swift action, the knight of avarice is able to generate a 10 foot aura that causes any magical healing given to one of your enemies to instead target any ally of your choice within your aura, healing them regardless of whether they are healed by positive or negative energies. This aura lasts for one minute, until the knight of avarice dismisses it (as a free action), or it is discharged (see below), whichever comes first. If one of the knight of avarice’s allies within the aura of selfishness is damaged by any magical spell or effect (including damage done by magical weapons) inflicted by an enemy, the knight of avarice may speak a word of rebuke as an immediate action that forces that enemy to make a DC (10 + ½ your class level + your Charisma modifier) Will save or be forced to use the same attack upon one of their allies. If they are unable to repeat the attack (i.e. they no longer have that spell or spell-like ability available, or they have no remaining allies), they are instead dazed for one round. This word of rebuke immediately ends the equalizing aura.

### Aura of Righteousness/Depravity
- Aura of Ambition (Su): You gain DR 5/vorpal and immunity to compulsion spells and spell-like abilities. Each enemy within 10 feet of her gains a -4 morale penalty on saving throws against compulsion effects. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. This ability functions only while the character is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.
- Aura of Hopelessness (Su): You gain DR 5/good and immunity to spells and spell-like abilities with the good descriptor. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities with the good descriptor. This effect lasts for 10 minutes. This ability functions only while the character is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.

### Holy Champion/Unholy Champion
- Champion of Freedom (Su): Your spirit finally becomes free to do as you will. For one hour, you gain the benefits of the spell freedom of movement as a constant spell-like ability. Whenever you use your lay on hands ability, you also grant them the benefits of freedom of movement for one round. In addition, when you use your censure and successfully stroke an evil outsider, the outsider is also subject to a harm, using your class level as your caster level. After the harm effect and the damage from the attack is resolved, the censure immediately ends.
- Champion of Tyranny (Su): The right to rule is one that fills you with sublime purpose. For one hour, your DR increases to 10/good.
Furthermore, as a standard action, you may fill one living creature within 30 feet with trembling awe, forcing it as a compulsion effect to make a DC (10 + your character level + your Charisma modifier) Will save or fall to the ground and prostrate itself before you. Flying creatures incapable of hovering must land immediately in order to prostrate themselves. This creature is considered to be helpless for the duration of the effect. Each round on its turn, a target of this effect may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that makes the initial save to resist this spell is merely staggered for 1 round.
- Champion of Vice (Su): You gain the power to inspire sinful acts in those around you. As a standard action, you make select any one humanoid target within 30 feet and bestow upon them an invisible mark of corruption as a ranged touch attack. Your target may make a DC (10 + your class level + your Charisma modifier) Fortitude save to resist the mark’s effects. The mark persists for 24 hours, and spells such as true seeing reveal the vile mark upon the target’s body. If it is successful, you may select one of the following vices to mark them with; the effects of which are based upon the nature of the mark. The mark can be removed with a limited wish or wish spell, but you may have no more than (your Intelligence modifier) marks active at any time, with no more than a single mark on any individual target.
    - Avarice: Your target becomes obsessed with some nearby object of your choosing and ignores everything else that doesn’t try to take away that object, destroy the object, or attack your target. If your target is attacked, it will run away at top speed, fighting only if it cannot run. If anything takes away the object of your target’s desire, they will become immediately hostile and attack the offender with their most effective or powerful attacks to get it back as soon as possible, completely losing interest once they have regained the object. While affected, it will refer to the object of its obsession by some pet name (i.e. “dearest”, “darling”, “treasure”, etc). If the target possesses 8 or fewer HD, they must make a DC 30 Will save or be permanently affected by this obsession. This is a compulsion effect.
    - Envy: Your target becomes obsessed with being better, in some fashion, than another humanoid target within sight that you designate, who becomes the subject of their envy. If the affected character is helpful or friendly toward the subject of their envy, they will attempt to compete in every possible way with them, acting recklessly in the process. They must succeed at a DC 30 Will save each time they do something dangerous or ill-advised as they compete with the subject of their envy; success means that they are able to maintain control and good sense, failing to act in a dangerous or reckless fashion. If your target is indifferent or unfriendly, they will attempt to sabotage the efforts of the subject of their envy as they compete with them, cheating in competition or placing the subject of their envy at risk at every possible opportunity. Should they succeed at a DC (10 + your class level + your Charisma modifier) Will save, they may refrain from such underhanded behaviors for one action. Should your target be hostile toward the subject of their envy, they will attack and attempt to kill them with all possible haste. Each hour that they remain under this compulsion effect, their attitude toward the subject of their envy automatically shifts one step toward hostile. If your target possesses 8 or fewer HD, they must make a DC 30 Will save or be permanently affected by this effect.
    - Gluttony: Your target is overcome with ravenous hunger and must find food. What they eat does not matter, but each waking hour that they do not eat causes them 1d8 points of nonlethal damage and gain the staggered condition, which lasts until you eat. They must consume at least a pound of food in order to satiate their hunger, though upon waking they must consume four pounds of food to properly break their fast. In addition to binge-eating, targets affected by this vile mark seek out other excesses, the most common being excessive drinking, gambling or carousing. While the mark remains in effect, the target gains a -5 penalty to all actions that do not involve satiating their hunger for excesses. If your target possesses 8 or fewer HD, they must make a DC 30 Will save or be permanently affected by this obsession. They will gain 10 pounds per week, and for each 10% of their original body weight that they gain, their clothing and armor will no longer fit and will require replacement. For every 30% of their original body weight that they gain, they lose 1 point of Constitution and 1 point of Dexterity. This is a compulsion effect.
    - Lust: Your target is overcome by unbridled lust for the nearest sexually compatible creature, which is determined by the target’s normal sexual preferences. The target is filled with the compulsion to rush to the subject of its lust and passionately kiss, caress or otherwise couple with that subject for the duration of this effect, taking no other actions. If there is no sexually compatible creature nearby, they suffer a -5 penalty to all actions that do not involve sating their lustful desires. If your target possesses 8 or fewer HD, they must make a DC 30 Will save or be permanently affected by this lustful behavior, constantly seeking out sexual encounters. For every day that passes without a sexual encounter, the target loses a point of Intelligence, becoming more and more a slave to their own passions.
    - Pride: The target of this compulsion effect is filled with hubris, stubbornly refusing aid from anyone, taking on unnecessary risks by themselves, and becoming incredibly boastful. They will actively seek to avoid receiving healing (magical or otherwise) or enhancing magics (such as bull’s strength or heroic invocation), and will prefer to fight without their best weapons and armor, discarding them at the first opportune moment and challenging their foes to unarmed combat, secure in the knowledge that they can win (even if their foes don’t fight them on equal terms). They must succeed at a DC 30 Will save any time they wish to refrain from doing something that would put them at a disadvantage. Additionally, they suffer a -5 penalty to Charisma-based checks as they become so unbearable that all those around them are repulsed by their egotism and narcissism. If your target possesses 8 or fewer HD, they must make a DC 30 Will save or be permanently affected by this prideful behavior.
    - Sloth: Targets affected by this compulsion loses all interest in everything. They will not make attacks of opportunity, will not cast defensive spells, and take a -5 penalty on all rolls unless they succeed at a DC (10 + your class level + your Charisma modifier) Will save upon attempting to take each action. If your target possesses 8 or fewer HD, they must make a DC 30 Will save or be permanently affected by this mark, failing to take care of themselves and wasting away to nothing, losing 1 point of Constitution each day.
    - Wrath: Seething hatred burns within the target that bears this mark. Each round, they must make a DC (10 + your class level + your Charisma modifier) Will save or immediately attack the nearest creature (friend or foe) with their most powerful or effective attacks or spells. If they continue to fail their Will saves, they will not stop until all creatures within sight are dead, after which, they will seek out more creatures to kill. They gain a +4 profane bonus to attack rolls, and become immune to the shaken and frightened conditions while under the influence of this effect, but a -4 penalty to Will saves. If your target possesses 8 or fewer HD, they must make a DC 30 Will save or be permanently affected by this mark, spending their days in slaughter until they are, themselves, killed. This is a compulsion effect.
- Unpredictable Champion (Su): Your battle prowess becomes as capricious as you are. Your DR increases to 10/lawful. Additionally, each round, you roll 2d4 and consult the table below to determine the effects of your unpredictable champion ability. Finally, your initiative bonus from detect danger increases by 2.
    - 2: Whenever you use illicit drive, your critical threat range is doubled. This explicitly stacks with other effects that expand the threat range of your weapon (such as the keen weapon property or the improved critical feat).
    - 3: Your skin hardens like stone and you become immune to critical hits and precision damage.
    - 4: Your weapon gains the anarchic property. If it already possesses this property, it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against all of lawful alignment. You also act as if you were under the effects of the haste spell.
    - 5: Whenever you use illicit drive and successfully strike a lawful outsider, or a lawfully-aligned dragons, they gain the confused condition for 1d4 rounds; constructs are dazed for 1d4 rounds. You also act as if you were under the effects of the blink spell.
    - 6: You gain a +4 insight bonus to attack and damage rolls and gain the ability to jump up to 50 feet in any direction as a swift action.
    - 7: You gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and you become immune to spells and spell-like effects with the mind-affecting descriptor.
    - 8: As a standard action, you are capable of inflicting a warpwave upon any target within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The target can resist your warpwave’s effects with a DC (10 + your class level + your Charisma modifier) Will save. It otherwise behaves like warpwaves generated by proteans.
