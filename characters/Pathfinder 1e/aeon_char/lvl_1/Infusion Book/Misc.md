### Shield Other - abjuration, lvl 2
From *Forgefather's Hammer* (CL 3)
| Activation | 1 standard action, does not provoke
| Components | Hit target's shield/armor with hammer
| Range      | close
| Target     | one creature
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl (D)
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus on saves. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks (including those dealt by special abilities) that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level draining, and death effects, are not affected. If the subject suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is not reassigned to the subject.

If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.

### Air Bubble - conjuration (creation), lvl 1
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one creature or one object no larger than a Large 2h weapon
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl

*Air bubble* creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature’s head or the touched object. The air bubble allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage. A firearm within an air bubble can be loaded—assuming the black powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight protective device—and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the shot still takes the standard –2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to range. If a firearm within the air bubble explodes, the explosion occurs normally.

If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make an Escape Artist check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a competence bonus on this check equal to twice your caster level (maximum +20).

If you do not have the aura of resolve class ability, this spell has no effect on any charm effects on the target.
