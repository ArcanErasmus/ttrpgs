    - frontier peasant, father met mother when she already had one son (elf father), and they set out on the frontier. after settling in the community, they had a daughter, then a pair of daughters, where mother died in childbirth. father got sucked into the growing cult, remarried (half-orc mother) and had another daughter. I was inducted into the cult as well, but one day I was tasked with manipulating a criminal on the run, to distract him for the cult to capture and sacrifice. Seeing the horror on the captive before he was sacrificed scarred me, leading me to want to leave home. When searching through forbidden materials, I found a book on the Order of the Songbird, but was discovered by a cultist. The cultist was sympathetic to my views, also looking for a way to escape, and so helped me learn and hone my abilities. She taught me to control the spirit channeling that the cult was trying to use to posess people, and to seek repentance and healing through art, immortalizing but externalizing the experiences that continued to haunt my thoughts. Finally, she gave me the supplies and knowledge to flee the town.
