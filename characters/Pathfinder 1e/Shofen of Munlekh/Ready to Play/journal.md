- Birth and early life
    - My father met my mother when she already had one son (via Etimis, elven father), and they set out on the frontier. After settling in the young town of Munlekh, they had a daughter (Bhullas), then a pair of daughters (Shino and myself), where mother died in childbirth. Father, vulnerable in his grief, was sucked into the growing cult in Munlekh (lead by Maunresh of Munlekh). Later, he would remarry, taking the hand of a fellow cultist (Alldog, half-orc mother), and they would have another daughter (Fernild).
    - I was inducted into the cult as well, but one day I was tasked with manipulating a criminal on the run (Erred of ?), to distract him for the cult to capture. Seeing and hearing his horror before the cult sacrificed him scarred me, leading me to into what cult was hiding. When searching through a library forbidden to all but the cult leaders, I found a book on spiritual rituals, but was discovered by a cultist (Aggu of Munlekh). Aggu was sympathetic to my views, also looking for a way to escape, and so helped me learn and hone my abilities. She taught me to control the spirit channeling that the cult was using to posess people, and to seek repentance and healing through art, immortalizing but externalizing the experiences that continued to haunt my thoughts. Finally, she gave me the supplies and knowledge to flee the town.
- Other details of growth and development
    - Had several inconsequential relationships, a few in Munlekh, and a few later on. None were very deep or lasting.
- Independent life
    - After leaving Munlekh, I traveled to ?, where I joined a monastic temple, training martial and divine capabilities under Master Olov Gevek. There I delved into the faiths of the world without fear of cult repression, desiring to leave my spiritual channeling behind.
    - One day, however, I felt a calling to pick back up my spirit planchette, and performed a seance. With my mind more open than before, I felt not a handful of spirits but the overwhelming presence of Pharasma. I was left with the sense of a duty given to me, to return and destroy the manipulative cult leaders, and help the restless spirits they trapped pass peacefully to the great beyond.
    - As I journeyed closer to Munlekh I felt my connection to the spirits grow, and could hear them calling out to be freed. At night I entered the town and snuck into the church, mainly to make sure there was nobody being held captive there, and to look for other evils the cult may have been performing. While searching Maunresh's study for evidence, I tripped a silent alarm and awoke him. As I heard footsteps approaching, I stood fast in the open, and confronted Maunresh when he entered the room. Seeing me as a danger to the cult and his power, he attacked, and we had a grueling battle. At one point he reached for a gem containing a multitude of trapped souls, to siphon their energy, but I moved quickly and smashed it.
    - The resulting explosion knocked me out and leveled the entire church. When I came to in one of the town doctor's beds, Maunresh was dead, and I felt a great attunement to the spiritual world. Looking around, most of the town was gone, and the remaining members told me how my father had lead the rest of the cult in a pilgrimage out of Munlekh, to flee to where they could set up again. But it had been over a week since, and they were long gone. Furthermore, the formerly-trapped spirits were in chaos, many manifesting and haunting the town. By the time Munlekh was stabilized and the spirits put to rest, it was too late to chase after my family. And so I set out on my own, headed to ?
- where do i come in?
    - ???
