### Detect Chaos - divination
This spell functions like *detect evil*, except that it detects the auras of chaotic creatures, clerics of chaotic deities, chaotic spells, and chaotic magic items, and you are vulnerable to an overwhelming chaotic aura if you are lawful.

#### {*Detect evil* - divination} reproduced below:
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone
| Duration   | C, up to 10 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
- 1st Round: Presence or absence of evil.
- 2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the power of the most potent evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, and the strongest evil aura’s power is overwhelming (see below), and the HD or level of the aura’s source is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends.
- 3rd Round: The power and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

An evil aura’s power depends on the type of evil creature or object that you’re detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric/paladin with an aligned deity) class level; see the table below. If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.

| Aura Power                   | No | Faint | Mod   | Str   | Ovr |
|------------------------------|----|-------|-------|-------|-----|
| Aligned creature{1}, HD      | 4- | 5-10  | 11-25 | 26-50 | 51+ |
| Aligned Undead, HD           | —  | 2-    | 3-8   | 9-20  | 21+ |
| Aligned Outsider, HD         | —  | 1-    | 2-4   | 5-10  | 11+ |
| Cleric/Paladin, class lvl    | —  | 1     | 2-4   | 5-10  | 11+ |
| Aligned magic item/spell, CL | 5- | 6-10  | 11-15 | 16-20 | 21+ |
{1} Except for Undead and Outsider, which have their own entries on the table.
{2} Some characters who are not clerics may radiate an aura of equivalent power. The class description will indicate whether this applies.

Lingering Aura: An evil aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a creature or magic item). If *detect evil* is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

| Strength     | Duration    |
|--------------|-------------|
| Faint        | 1d6 rds     |
| Moderate     | 1d6 mins    |
| Strong       | 1d6x10 mins |
| Overwhelming | 1d6 days    |

Animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil, and as such this spell does not detect them. Creatures with actively evil intents count as evil creatures for the purpose of this spell.

Each round, you can turn to detect evil in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

### Detect Fiendish Presence - divination
|------------|--------------
| Components | V,S
This spell functions like *detect evil*, except that it detects only outsiders with the evil subtype, as well as the lingering effects caused by their gifts, presence, and spells. It can also detect clerics and paladins of fiendish deities, including Asmodeus, archdevils, daemonic harbingers, and demon lords.

### Detect Magic - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone
| Duration   | C, up to 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
- 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
- 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
- 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties.

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the infusion indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers. Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The infusion can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

*Detect magic* can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

### Detect Psychic Significance - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 40 ft
| Area       | 40 ft radius burst, centered on you
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You detect the presence of psychically significant items in your vicinity. Such items are those that might have significant psychic imprints or histories that can be read by the psychometry occult skill unlock, or items under the effects of the charge object or implant false reading spells. Items within range that contain significant psychic energy spark a recognition in your mind’s eye, but no other information is imparted. This spell doesn’t automatically detect magic items or strongly aligned items, though such items often have storied histories and might have had previous owners who possessed psychic abilities.

### Grave Words - necromancy [language-dependent]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 minute
| Components | S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one dead creature
| Duration   | 1 round
With this spell and a touch, you can force a corpse talk to you, but you can’t ask it specific questions or communicate with it at all. The corpse will start babbling for 1 round, spitting out random sentences. There is a 10% chance this information is of some use to the caster, but it is difficult to distinguish whether the information is useful (the GM makes the percentile roll in secret).

Useful information may include warnings about dangers deeper in a dungeon, the command word to a magic item, or even vague and spectral warnings of your or your companions’ future. The GM decides what information, useful or not, the corpse spews out in its babbling.

Once a corpse has been subject to grave words by any caster, any new attempt to cast grave words on that corpse fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the head of the corpse must have a mouth in order to speak at all. This spell doesn’t affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.

### Guidance - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 min or until discharged
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes
This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance.

The creature gets a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.

### Light - evocation [light]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,M/DF (a firefly)
| Range      | touch
| Target     | object touched
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This spell causes a touched object to glow like a torch, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius from the point touched, and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). In an area of normal or bright light, this spell has no effect. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object.

You can only have one *light* spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent (through *permanency* or a similar effect), it does not count against this limit. *Light* can be used to counter or dispel any darkness spell of equal or lower spell level.

### Read Magic - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 10 min/lvl
You can decipher magical  inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the infusion is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The infusion allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

*Read magic* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

## 1st lvl
### Calm Spirit - necromancy
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one incorporeal undead creature or haunt
| Duration   | 1 min or 1 rd/lvl; see text
| Save       | Will neg or none; see text
| SR         | yes
This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead such as ghosts. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm spirit postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the effect.

Haunts do not receive a saving throw against the spell, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check whose difficulty is equal to at least 10 + the haunt’s CR in order to temporarily calm the angry entity. The spell’s duration changes to concentration (up to 1 round/level) when affecting a haunt.

### Cure Light Wounds - conjuration (healing)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will half (harmless); see text
| SR         | yes (harmless); see text
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply Spell Resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

### Identify - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (wine stirred with an owl's feather)
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped emanation
| Duration   | 3 rds/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This infusion functions as *detect magic*, except that it gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This infusion does not allow you to identify artifacts.

### Object Reading - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one touched object
| Duration   | C, up to 1 rd/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You read the psychic impressions left upon an object by emotionally or psychically charged events in the item’s history, or the information imprinted by the charge object or implant false reading spells. This spell returns the same information as the psychometry occult skill unlock, but gives 1 piece of information when cast and requires 1 round of concentration per additional piece of information instead of 1 minute. You must still attempt an Appraise check to see how much information you gain. You gain a +10 competence bonus on the check.

### Shocking Grasp - evocation [electricity]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature or object touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal).

### Snowball - conjuration (creation) [cold, water]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Effect     | one ball of ice and snow
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Fort partial; see text
| SR         | yes
You conjure a ball of packed ice and snow that you can throw at a single target as a ranged touch attack. The snowball deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 5d6) on a successful hit, and the target must make a successful Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round.

## 2nd lvl
### Instant Weapon - conjuration (creation) [force]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 0 ft
| Effect     | melee weapon of opaque force
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
You create a melee weapon sized appropriately for you from opaque force. You are considered proficient with this weapon, which acts in all ways as a masterwork weapon typical of its type. The instant weapon has hardness 20 and the same number of hit points as a typical weapon of its type. As a force effect, it can strike and damage incorporeal creatures. If the instant weapon leaves your hand at any time, the spell ends at the beginning of your next turn.

### Restoration, Lesser - conjuration (healing)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 3 rds
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes (harmless)
*Lesser restoration* dispels any magical effects reducing one of the subject’s ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject’s ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the character, and improves an exhausted condition to fatigued. It does not restore permanent ability drain.
