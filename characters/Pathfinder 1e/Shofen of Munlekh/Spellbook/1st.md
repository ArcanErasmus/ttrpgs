# Shofen's Spellbook - 1st Level
### Bestow Planar Infusion - evocation
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 hr/lvl
| Save       | Fort neg (harmless)
| SR         | yes
This spell draws upon the latent planar energy of the caster’s surroundings, allowing her to temporarily infuse a creature with the plane’s power. The touched creature gains that plane’s basic infusion for the spell’s duration. This spell has no effect if cast on the Material Plane, and it ends as soon as the spell’s target leaves the plane with which it has been infused. Details on planar infusions can be found in each plane’s Infusion section.

Once a creature gains the benefits of bestow planar infusion I, it remains attuned to that plane for 24 hours. Additional castings of bestow planar infusion I during this time bestow the same infusion that was granted by the initial casting that day. Planar infusions that can be used a limited number of times per day are not refreshed by multiple castings of bestow planar infusion I.

### Calm Spirit - necromancy
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | close
| Target     | one incorporeal undead creature or haunt
| Duration   | 1 min or 1 rd/lvl; see text
| Save       | Will neg or none; see text
| SR         | yes
This spell temporarily calms agitated haunts and incorporeal undead such as ghosts. You have no control over the affected creatures, but calm spirit postpones hostile action by the affected spirits for the duration of the spell. Entities so affected cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive, including triggering persistent haunt abilities, though they can defend themselves. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed spirit or haunt immediately ends the effect.

Haunts do not receive a saving throw against the spell, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check whose difficulty is equal to at least 10 + the haunt’s CR in order to temporarily calm the angry entity. The spell’s duration changes to concentration (up to 1 round/level) when affecting a haunt.

### Cure Light Wounds - conjuration (healing)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | instantaneous
| Save       | Will half (harmless); see text
| SR         | yes (harmless); see text
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply Spell Resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

### Identify - divination

| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (wine stirred with an owl's feather)
| Range      | 60 ft
| Area       | cone-shaped emanation
| Duration   | 3 rds/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
This infusion functions as *detect magic*, except that it gives you a +10 enhancement bonus on Spellcraft checks made to identify the properties and command words of magic items in your possession. This infusion does not allow you to identify artifacts.

### Object Reading - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | touch
| Target     | one touched object
| Duration   | C, up to 1 rd/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
You read the psychic impressions left upon an object by emotionally or psychically charged events in the item’s history, or the information imprinted by the charge object or implant false reading spells. This spell returns the same information as the psychometry occult skill unlock, but gives 1 piece of information when cast and requires 1 round of concentration per additional piece of information instead of 1 minute. You must still attempt an Appraise check to see how much information you gain. You gain a +10 competence bonus on the check.

### Psychic Reading - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V
| Range      | close
| Target     | one humanoid creature
| Duration   | 1 rd
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
You are able to read a person’s surface thoughts and take cues from the person’s appearance, body language, and manner of speech to infer a great deal of information about the person, even if that person is in disguise (including polymorph effects). When casting the spell, attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive check with a bonus equal to your caster level.

A successful skill check reveals to you one of the following pieces of information of your choice, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds 20: age, alignment, class†, feats†, gender, native language, place of origin, race or ethnicity, racial traits†, religion, sexual orientation, or training in a Craft, Perform, or Profession skill. For items marked with a cross (†), if the target has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as a piece of information.

There’s a 70% chance that all information you receive is correct. This roll is made secretly. Otherwise, on a roll of 71–80, You receive one false piece of information, on a roll of 81–90 you receive two, and on a roll of 91–100 you receive three. You can’t get more false information than the total number of pieces of information you discover.

Your successful melee touch attack deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). When delivering the jolt, you gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls if the opponent is wearing metal armor (or is carrying a metal weapon or is made of metal).

### Snowball - conjuration (creation) [cold, water]

### Touch of Truthtelling - enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
This spell functions identically to the spell *zone of truth*, except as noted above. The target momentarily takes on the semblance of a being of perfect order, like an archon or inevitable, so that all who can see the target know it is affected by the spell. This divine guise flickers over the target for only an instant and does not allow it to pass as a member of a different race.

#### {*Zone of Truth* - enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]} reproduced below:
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,DF
| Range      | close
| Area       | 20 ft radius emanation
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
| Save       | Will neg
| SR         | yes
Creatures within the emanation area (or those who enter it) can’t speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature is allowed a save to avoid the effects when the spell is cast or when the creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment. Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
