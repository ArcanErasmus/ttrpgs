# Cheatsheet
## Rolling Dice
- Roll 1d10, +1d10 for each of a relevant {skill, domain, mastery}
- If others help, +1d10 for each, but they mark stress if you do
- GM may remove one or two dice for high difficulty
- If total dice <1, roll 1 and reduce outcome by a step per die <1
- Single highest die roll determines outcome:
| #   | Outcome        | Consequences
|-----|----------------|--------------
| 10  | Crit Success   | If inflicting Stress, deal +1 stress per die showing 10
| 8-9 | Success        |
| 6-7 | Costly Success | Mark stress
| 2-5 | Failure        | Mark stress
| 1   | Crit Failure   | Mark double stress

## Stress
- Mark stress on roll =<7, or dealing with magic or sunlight
- To mark stress, GM rolls and adds the result from your current stress
- To clear stress, player rolls and subtracts the result
- Stress die can be d3, d6, d8 depending on risk or commitment of the char
- You can inflict stress on NPCs to overcome them

- You can clear stress in various ways:
    - *Lay low* - Do nothing but recover; clears all stress, but plot moves on
    - *Act* - Treatment, earning, new identity, etc; clear a dice worth from one res
    - *Refresh* - Act to your nature; clear stress from any combination of resistances
    - *Abilities* - Some characters can clear stress
    - *Fallout* - Clears a fixed amount, based on severity

- Stress from sunlight:
    - Goes to Blood or Mind
    - d6, d3 if protected, 1 if minor or overcast/sunset/sunrise

## Fallout
- When you mark stress, GM rolls a d10
- If they roll under your total stress in any res, you suffer fallout
- Severity of the fallout is determined by sum total stress
- Fallout type is the stress type of the roll that triggered it
- Two fallouts can be merged into next higher severity, and vice versa

- *Minor fallout (2-4 Stress)*
    - Bleeding, incurring debts, being shaken and so on
    - Can be treated or mitigated with effort
    - Clears 3 stress

    - Breaking limbs, acquiring phobias, being arrested etc
    - Can be stabilised or managed with time and effort
    - Clears 5 stress
- *Severe fallout (9+ Stress; automatic if 11+)* 
    - Obsessive behaviour, exile, death; the worst
    - Usually permanent

## Resistances
- Resistances may have bonuses - "free slots"
- Don't count stress in free slots when checking for fallout
- Armor is special Blood bonus which is cleared at end of each situation
