## Abilities
### Surprise Infiltration
Nothing can keep you out. `Once per session, insert yourself into a situation where you are not currently present`, so long as there’s some conceivable way you could get in there.

### Bound Blade
You have captured a god and forced it into your blade. As a Bound, you gain a god-knife or god-axe blade when you join the order, and bind a small god inside it with a bloody and dark ritual. `This weapon has the Bound tag, and as such you can use your class abilities through it.` You can’t use your abilities through another weapon, but if your Bound weapon is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one with a night-long, exhausting rite held back in Perch.

### The Secret of the Crowd [Divine]
You can hide in plain sight, so long as there are others around. +1 Shadow. `When you wear your mask and stand in a crowd, you will blend into the background` (though not become invisible) unless you do something out of the ordinary to attract attention.

### The Secret of Lucky Breaks [Divine]
Your gods see to it that you’re never without small luxuries. +1 Mind, +1 Reputation. `Your bottle always has a little bit of liquor left in it, your crumpled cigarette packet always contains three cigarettes, and your box of spireblack matches always contains one match.` (You can’t use this ability to give out infinite cigarettes and booze to loads of other people in an attempt to make money; the gods will resent the abuse, and cease to aid you.)

### The Saint of Ways [Divine]
No lock will impede your progress. Gain the Steal skill. `When you wear your gloves and try to open a door, that door is unlocked and unbarred.` It works on windows and trapdoors, but not chests, display cases or safes – it only allows access to portals big enough for an adult drow to fit through.

### Second Chances [Divine]
You know a minor prayer to the Goddess of luck, often used by gamblers. After you’ve rolled dice to resolve an action but before play continues, `mark up to 3 stress (against any resistance` you wish) and mutter a prayer to Stolz under your breath. You may `re-roll as many dice as you marked stress`.

## Bonds
### Zikonna, my mother
We have a very strained relationship, because a long time ago, I attempted to gamble my father away to Stolz (and she found out, probably because I told her). Stolz didn't take him, but later he ended up leaving my mother for a new partner. This let us patch our relationship somewhat, but when Stolz or gambling comes up, it reopens old wounds. She still wants to love me dearly, though I don't often feel I deserve it, as I am the thing most dear to her. It's complicated.

**### ???**
- You have a bond with one of the other PCs who you rescued from a dangerous situation. Describe the situation they found themselves in.

# Cheat Sheet
## Rolling Dice
- Roll 1d10, +1d10 for each of a relevant {skill, domain, mastery}
- If others help, +1d10 for each, but they mark stress if you do
- GM may remove one or more dice for high difficulty
- If total dice <1, roll 1 and reduce outcome by a step per die <1
- Single highest die roll determines outcome:
| #   | Outcome        | Consequences
|-----|----------------|--------------
| 10  | Crit Success   | If inflicting Stress, deal +1 stress per die showing 10
| 8-9 | Success        |
| 6-7 | Costly Success | Mark stress
| 2-5 | Failure        | Mark stress
| 1   | Crit Failure   | Mark double stress

## Stress
- Mark stress on roll =<7, or dealing with magic or sunlight
- To mark stress, GM rolls and adds the result from your current stress
- To clear stress, player rolls and subtracts the result
- Stress die can be d3, d6, d8 depending on risk or commitment of the char
- You can inflict stress on NPCs to overcome them

- You can clear stress in various ways:
    - *Lay low* - Do nothing but recover; clears all stress, but plot moves on
    - *Act* - Treatment, earning, new identity, etc; clear a dice worth from one res
    - *Refresh* - Act to your nature; clear stress from any combination of resistances
    - *Abilities* - Some characters can clear stress
    - *Fallout* - Clears a fixed amount, based on severity

## Knacks
If you would gain a skill or domain you already have, instead pick a knack in that skill or domain. A knack is a specific area of expertise (e.g. first aid for Fix, smuggling for Crime etc.) in which you always have mastery.

## Fallout
- When you mark stress, GM rolls a d10
- If they roll under your total stress in any res, you suffer fallout
- Severity of the fallout is determined by sum total stress
- Fallout type is the stress type of the roll that triggered it
- Two fallouts can be merged into next higher severity, and vice versa

- *Minor fallout (2-4 Stress)*
    - Bleeding, incurring debts, being shaken and so on
    - Can be treated or mitigated with effort
    - Clears 3 stress
- *Major fallout (5-8 Stress)*
    - Breaking limbs, acquiring phobias, being arrested etc
    - Can be stabilised or managed with time and effort
    - Clears 5 stress
- *Severe fallout (9+ Stress; automatic if 11+)* 
    - Obsessive behaviour, exile, death; the worst
    - Usually permanent
    - Clears 7 stress

## Resistances
- Resistances may have bonuses - "free slots"
- Don't count stress in free slots when checking for fallout
- Armor is special Blood bonus which is cleared at end of each situation
- Bonds with NPCs can suffer stress/fallout, tracked separately by GM
