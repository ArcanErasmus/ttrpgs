## Abilities
### Surprise Infiltration
Nothing can keep you out. `Once per session, insert yourself into a situation where you are not currently present`, so long as there’s some conceivable way you could get in there.

### Bound Blade
You have captured a god and forced it into your blade. As a Bound, you gain a god-knife or god-axe blade when you join the order, and bind a small god inside it with a bloody and dark ritual. `This weapon has the Bound tag, and as such you can use your class abilities through it.` You can’t use your abilities through another weapon, but if your Bound weapon is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one with a night-long, exhausting rite held back in Perch.

### The Secret of the Crowd [Divine]
You can hide in plain sight, so long as there are others around. +1 Shadow. `When you wear your mask and stand in a crowd, you will blend into the background` (though not become invisible) unless you do something out of the ordinary to attract attention.

### The Secret of Lucky Breaks [Divine]
Your gods see to it that you’re never without small luxuries. +1 Mind, +1 Reputation. `Your bottle always has a little bit of liquor left in it, your crumpled cigarette packet always contains three cigarettes, and your box of spireblack matches always contains one match.` (You can’t use this ability to give out infinite cigarettes and booze to loads of other people in an attempt to make money; the gods will resent the abuse, and cease to aid you.)

### The Saint of Ways [Divine]
No lock will impede your progress. Gain the Steal skill. `When you wear your gloves and try to open a door, that door is unlocked and unbarred.` It works on windows and trapdoors, but not chests, display cases or safes – it only allows access to portals big enough for an adult drow to fit through.

### Second Chances [Divine]
You know a minor prayer to the Goddess of luck, often used by gamblers. After you’ve rolled dice to resolve an action but before play continues, `mark up to 3 stress (against any resistance` you wish) and mutter a prayer to Stolz under your breath. You may `re-roll as many dice as you marked stress`.

## Bonds
### Zikonna, my mother
We have a very strained relationship, because a long time ago, I attempted to gamble my father away to Stolz (and she found out, probably because I told her). Stolz didn't take him, but later he ended up leaving my mother for a new partner. This let us patch our relationship somewhat, but when Stolz or gambling comes up, it reopens old wounds. She still wants to love me dearly, though I don't often feel I deserve it, as I am the thing most dear to her. It's complicated.
    - This mission is where she learns I'm a Minister. Hopefully, for saving her life, she won't sell me out.

**### [Replacement for Mox]**
- Bond with one of the other PCs who you rescued from a dangerous situation. Describe the situation they found themselves in.
