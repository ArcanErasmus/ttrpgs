## Fallout
### Active
none

### Resolved
Night Terrors - "You feel a presence at the edge of your mind. You've given something very important up to Stolz". Fleck was wracked by nightmares and sleep paralysis while being watched by a spider-lady. Manic and sleep-deprived, she felt a calling to The Garden (the Witching Wood), where she met Phalqa, the drider from her dreams. After being inducted into The Gardeners, the nightmares stopped.

## Bound Abilities
### Surprise Infiltration - Basic
Nothing can keep you out. `Once per session, insert yourself into a situation where you are not currently present`, so long as there’s some conceivable way you could get in there.

### Bound Blade - Basic
You have captured a god and forced it into your blade. As a Bound, you gain a god-knife or god-axe blade when you join the order, and bind a small god inside it with a bloody and dark ritual. `This weapon has the Bound tag, and as such you can use your class abilities through it.` You can’t use your abilities through another weapon, but if your Bound weapon is lost or destroyed, you can create a new one with a night-long, exhausting rite held back in Perch.

### The Secret of the Crowd [Divine] - Low
You can hide in plain sight, so long as there are others around. +1 Shadow. `When you wear your mask and stand in a crowd, you will blend into the background` (though not become invisible) unless you do something out of the ordinary to attract attention.

### The Secret of Lucky Breaks [Divine] - Low
Your gods see to it that you’re never without small luxuries. +1 Mind, +1 Reputation. `Your bottle always has a little bit of liquor left in it, your crumpled cigarette packet always contains three cigarettes, and your box of spireblack matches always contains one match.` (You can’t use this ability to give out infinite cigarettes and booze to loads of other people in an attempt to make money; the gods will resent the abuse, and cease to aid you.)

### The Saint of Ways [Divine] - Medium
No lock will impede your progress. Gain the Steal skill. `When you wear your gloves and try to open a door, that door is unlocked and unbarred.` It works on windows and trapdoors, but not chests, display cases or safes – it only allows access to portals big enough for an adult drow to fit through.

### The God of Shadows [Divine] - High
Your mask hides you, even from the light. +2 Shadow. At the start of a `situation, you cannot be seen unless you draw attention` to yourself by attacking or making a loud noise. You can `return to this state by marking D3 stress in Shadow or Blood`.

## Blood-Witch Abilities
### True Form [Occult] - Basic
Try as you might, you just can’t keep the writhing terror inside yourself. Since returning from the Heart, your true self pushes and boils beneath the surface of your skin. `If you ever take moderate or severe fallout` of any kind, you `shift into the form` that the Heart wishes you to be – a flickering zoetrope horror. Your fingers twitch and flex and your movements are stop-motion and disjointed; your shoulders pop and creak as they bend at the wrong points and the stench of old blood fills the air. You `gain the Compel and Pursue` skills, and anyone with an ounce of sense will most likely run from you. You `may attempt to stop this change with a Resist+Occult roll`. Your true form `lasts until the end of the situation`. You can mark `D3 stress to shift into your true form at any time`.
- Fleck's true form is her imposter syndrome made manifest. With a shudder, her skin smears and stains until it turns pitch black, and leaves soot marks anywhere she touches. Her face becomes stony and emotionless, and upon closer inspection appears to be another mask. Peeking behind it reveals a blank, smooth surface where the face should be.

### Blood-Bound Companion [Occult] - Low
You strengthen your bond with your familiar. +1 Mind. Your `familiar can talk to people` other than you. Sneak. Your `familiar can very briefly shift to become incorporeal`. You can take this advance again, choosing the other two abilities.

## Luck-Priest Abilities
### Second Chances [Divine] - Low
You know a minor prayer to the Goddess of luck, often used by gamblers. After you’ve rolled dice to resolve an action but before play continues, `mark up to 3 stress (against any resistance` you wish) and mutter a prayer to Stolz under your breath. You may `re-roll as many dice as you marked stress`.

## Minister Abilities
- none

## Bonds
### Zikonna, my mother - Individual
We have a very strained relationship, because I once attempted to gamble my father away to Stolz (she found out when I let it slip while high on victory). Stolz didn't take him, but later he ended up leaving my mother for a new partner. This let us patch our relationship somewhat, but when Stolz or gambling comes up, it reopens old wounds. She still wants to love me dearly, though I don't often feel I deserve to be the thing most dear to her. We have barely had any time to reconnect after the breakout.

### Santiago - PC
- Santiago is younger than you, sees you as a child in the Silver Quarter
- Santiago's father was a dealer in one of the casinos, Santiago was often dragged to work with him
- Fleck would take a protective interest in little Santiago
- Santiago makes the call for what Fleck should bet on, during that fateful hand

- Fleck encountered Santiago raging mad, obviously high on something. Unbeknownst to her, he is undertaking his Rite of Fury for his Ministry initiation. However, the cocktail of drugs administered by his Magister is reacting in strange and dangerous ways with his body. Fleck helps Santiago safely down from his high, and while he writhes in a feverish state, he mumbles a name over and over. Fleck believes this to be the person who did this to him, and tracks them down. When interrogation reveals no answers, and Fleck realizes it is she who has overshared, she kills them. After explaining what transpired, Santiago reinforces the lie that Fleck already believes. Santiago convinces her that he's safe to leave her care, and they part ways.

- Later, they meet in the Ministry, and their prior history (among other reasons) is why are chosen and placed in the same cell. Santiago never reveals that when she saved him, he was undertaking the Rite of Fury.

### Nancy - Individual
You lead this sacred hyena to safety after Kether was grabbed by the Hive guards during the legendary slaughter-heist. After being tainted yourself, you shared your diseased blood with her, empowering her intelligence. Suddenly understanding what happened to Kether, she wept for him, and black tears stained fractal streaks across her cheeks. As a memento, she wears a chest-wrap made from his old cape.
Her only request is that you `help her find Kether's body, assuming he's dead, and feed it to her`.

### Phalqa - PC
She appeared in your fitful dreams, watching over you every night. After feeling drawn to the Witching Wood, you met her and she initiated you into her little group, The Gardeners. The initiation was in equal parts violent and intimate. Anointing your god-knife with Phalqa's blood, you gave a quick prayer and plunged it into your chest. Instead of certain death, your wound convulsed and spat the blade back out, wracking your body with rapid mutations.
    **- You have tasted her blood, and learned a secret about their past (or future). What did you learn, and how often do you remind them of it?**

### Percy Three-Hundred-Years-Before-The-Fall - Individual
9 year old judge, scion of a noble family. Easily swayed by exactly what you'd imagine a kid would like.

## Background
--- Shoots Emerge From the Ground ---
Fleck was born into a typical Perch family. Poor, tough, and equally fearful of crime and crime-fighters. After watching an Aelfir force one of her friends to multilate another friend for their enjoyment, Fleck felt a passion for justice. As youth turned to adolescence, her home became a place of stress rather than comfort, for her parents Marl and Zikonna were always fighting. And so, Fleck would hang out with the Bound. There she found a group that cared for her, and kept her too busy to worry about home.

--- Small Stalks Weather the Elements ---
But, adolescence brings the Durance Day, and Fleck was hauled off to The Works. Seeing her rope skills, a foreman deemed her the best fit to scale the smokestacks and scrape the insides clean of soot. A silver lining to this miserable task was in realizing that the darkness caked on her clothes and body led to an ease of blending in with the walls themselves, a talent that kept her out of trouble on numerous occasions.

--- The Stem Splits into Branches ---
Upon returning from her servitude, Fleck saw only a broken home. Her father left for another woman, and her mother Zikonna had taken to pugilism to earn a living, or picking pockets when the winnings ran out. Struggling to connect to Zikonna after 4 years of significant change for the both of them, Fleck instead returned to the red-roped vigilantes she once knew. This was a period of general calm in Fleck's life, culminating in her laying a trap for a small god and snaring it in her blade. But, restlessness takes its inevitable hold, and she once again set out to find new purpose.

--- A Single Bud Begins to Form ---
When Fleck sits down for a game in The Mermaid, she feels a rush of excitement that she will spend a rarely-sober year chasing. Her gambling brings as much misery as it does joy, climaxing in a desperate and delirious Fleck betting the life of her estranged father Marl in a high-stakes match. In a twist of fate she wins the hand, walking away with both his life and enough Queens to pay off her debts tenfold.

--- Spring Rains are Cut Short by a Hot Summer ---
High on victory (and whatever they put in those cigars), Fleck stumbles home to Zikonna to share the good news. Blubbering out more of the story than she may have intended, Fleck sees not appreciation but horror staring back at her. As much as Zikonna hated Marl, she felt only rage and shame at hearing Fleck admit to using him as a betting chip. Vicious words are hurled on both sides, and Fleck storms out, returning to the Silver Quarter to seek solace. Taking more than one wrong turn, she instead spends the night in some forgotten alley, lost and homeless.

--- Water From a Pail Calms the Raging Heat ---
She awoke to an unfamiliar sight: A stranger tending to her, providing water and helping her wretch up the dangerous levels of booze and other substances ingested the previous day. Too weak to leave, Fleck was forced to rely on the kindness of this mysterious drow. In return, they asked not for a single Sten, only asked she listen to their offer of a purpose, of meaning and direction, that she could have. Now without a single friend or family member to turn to, Fleck was all too happy to accept.

--- Uncaring Dirt is Relieved of Duty by the Shovel ---
The aelfir are an everpresent burn in any drow's life, and Fleck was no different. It's no wonder then that the stranger's descriptions of injustices witnessed, of systematic horrors being actively inflicted upon them all, would rekindle the old vigilante spark still smoldering in her. What if she could cut the ropes holding up the systems of their oppressors? What if she could watch them all fall to their deaths, just as she did with the bully that stole her toy? For the stranger had been a Bound when Fleck was little, and had taken note of her willingness to risk everything for what she felt was right.

--- Roots Unceasingly Probe Unfamiliar Surroundings ---
The Rite of Tenacity: Three days without seeing a single living creature larger than a rat, without hearing anything loud enough to drown out your own heartbeat, without a single match for light, without a space tall enough to stand up straight in, can drive a drow to insanity. But Fleck kept walking, climbing, and crawling, with an unwavering certainty despite the maze of uncountable passages. It was a simple belief. Risk all, or save none.

--- Leaves Twist and Writhe Seeking Sunlight ---
The Rite of Fury: With every step deeper into the haze of smoke and spireblack around the Works, Fleck's rage grew. Sneaking into her old place of servitude was trivial, and almost as easy was ambushing and binding the foreman who would insult, beat, or whip any laborer around him, just for being nearby when he was having a bad day. He was always having a bad day. Today, however, would be a whole lot worse, as he would find himself face to face with a drow who he could honestly not remember, balancing him over the rim of a smokestack. Frightened and confused, he sputtered apologies that became threats as his masked captor finished binding him to the inside wall of the stack, and simply left. As the machines under him roared to life (for those indentured or employed there worked far more efficiently and happily without his presence), the sounds and smells of burning flesh simply faded into the general din and debris. It took three months for his absence to be noted by the higher-ups.

--- Buds Crack Open Revealing Hidden Beauty ---
The Rite of Grace: Seeing Fleck as a useful tool to tie up loose ends, she was burdened with the assignment of replacing an Azurite's bodyguard. Her first lesson was in just how little empathy those with wealth have, and how easy to fool they become. Despite having a very specific woman with unique mannerisms at her side, the Azurite never suspected her living shield of being not the woman she employed for years.

--- Swelling Berries Tax Reserves of Energy ---
The Rite of Vigilance: Magisters have a honed ability to blend into a crowd, while keeping their head on a swivel for enemies. But the Bound can take this power to another level, the small gods in their masks and clothes turning gazes away entirely. So it was that Fleck was able to patrol the streets until catching a glimpse of her quarry, her routine loitering never noticed by the man trying to evade her.

--- Plump Fruits Offer Themselves to Passers-by ---
The Rite of Community: Reckoning with the fact that your friends sometimes eat members of your species is not a trivial task. But it was one Fleck was forced to undertake, being sent to aid and even protect the Gutterkin of the Works from drow harassment. Confronting with her societally-ingrained biases was a necessary step in her donning the mantle of a revolutionary.

--- Deft Hands Sort Plucked Yields From Unwanted Sticks ---
The Rite of Sagacity: It's easy to believe society sits balanced on the tip of a needle, a light push away from grand collapse. What truly hurts is learning how stable the systems that oppress, how entrenched the tyrants. The sixth initiation flowed neatly into Fleck's first mission, as her eyes were opened to the financial realities of Spire. The Azurite was an ex-Magister, and selling out her former agents brought her a wealthy but rather short life. Having liquidated the woman and her assets in the name of Our Hidden Lady, Fleck was officially granted the title of Minister.
