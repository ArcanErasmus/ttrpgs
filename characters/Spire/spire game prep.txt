How evil are the Aelfir?
- A hive mind separated from their network, the Aelfir are an alien people attempting to cope with an unsolveable problem by engaging in an exaggerated fascimile of rulership and society. Their wild mood swings leave countless drow, gnolls, humans, and others dead or worse. While they would be genuinely happier and healthier if returned to their homeland, drow resistance is not about doing them a favor. They forfeitted all right to be pitied when they slaughtered and enslaved their way through Spire.
How mystic is the Ministry?
- Primarily a loose terrorist group, but like most poorly-understood things in Spire, it takes on a supernatural life of its own. Directives, attitudes, and even members can simply materialize, made manifest by the will of the people in concert with the will of the goddess, enabled by a lack of anyone in a position to question chance happenings.
How common is magic in general?
- About as common as hard drugs in America, and about as controlled. That is to say, the prevalence and type varies by locale, but you're never so far that you can avoid seeing its effects.

-Ivory Row:
    Spire Core page 110-113
        - Was important and lively 100 yrs ago, major trade used to be ivory exports, nobles migrated to Silver Quarter when Aelfir arrived.
        - 26 enigmatic shifting windows across the outer wall of Spire, which have gathered a following from several cults interested in reverse engineering them or simply divining meaning from their movements. The Sunlight Collective is a group of rich fools and artists sponsored by rich fools (Idols), that most artists pass through on their career.
        - Heavy guard presence to keep out the oppressed. Those who sneak in anyway and live in abandoned buildings known as the Hidden. Punishments generally but not exclusively light.
        - All land owned by three absentee landlords: Lady Theryn Thorns-on-Silk in the north, Mister Alas in Red Row, Archbishop Wynn in the east.
    Strata page 20-27
        - Aelfir wealth diverted economic focus on Silver Quarter due to reliance on human tech.
        - Aelfir landlord: Lady Theryn Thorns-on-Silk. Invested in Ivory Row at a bad time, lends to impoverished aelfir and increasingly to noble drow. Sutured on mask (servants do too), is undying and very old. Streets are fairly well guarded for guests' privacy/security, but buildings are poorly maintained. Silver Quarter leaks filthy water thru ceiling into here when it rains. Opposed by her far smarter younger sister Graziela, who is trying to undermine her claim to the family fortune.
        - Human landlord: Archbishop Wynn. Funding a megaconstruction to convert the entire district into a massive temple to the Solar faith. Believes the Heart prevents aelfir gods from physically manifesting in Spire, and is trying to burst it with mad human engineering underneath the church's foundations.
        - Drow landlord: Mister Alas. Takes illegal experimental human drug Dose to prevent ever needing sleep. Will provide for anyone with money, no questions asked. Full of wealthy sociopath tenants, ghosts and possession-junkies, and poor scavengers. Opposed by Anastasia Gris and her legions of henchmen, who aim to spread their drug trade (based upwards of the Garden district) into Red Row, and fight to undermine Alas's undercity control.
        - No-Drow's Land: Ruled by House Quinn, a drow mafia. Home to destitute noble scions, rich/ostentatious gangsters, and swarms of pigs/rats. Desperately ignored by the landlords, a great entrance for Ministers. Possibly the entire House is a Ministry front. Opposed by both the Ministry and the Crimson Vigil, who skirmish with each other within his territory just as often.
-Perch:
    Spire Core page 119-121
        - Patchwork collection of ramshackle and scavenged buildings affixed to the outer wall of Spire.
        - The Gutter: Only stable structure in Perch, overhang from a long-defunct sewer system. Workshops underneath produce most of Spire's rope.
        - Structural surfaces and important objects are worshipped as houses for one of an innumerable quantity of small gods.
        - Fallen and forgotten objects cared for by sepulchre-keepers (until the gods housed within have passed on) in a network of tunnels carved into the outer wall of Spire.
        - The Dovecote: Breeding farm for pigeons, doves, ravens, sparrows, maintained by specialized artisans. Megacorvids are rare here, but the best carrier pigeons are not. Ministry maintains accounts for use of carrier pigeons.
        - The Bound: Vigilantes of Perch, often sought for Ministry recruitment.

        - Computational Divison: A front for cult of The Intelligence (vast "prokatakos crystal" that processes information) who put data nodes in their brains.
        - Volatility Research: Recent upsurge in popularity for "galvanics", the harnessing of lightning.
        - Little Whitecross: Human-themed bars and inns, and performances of entertainments from the West (where humans are from).
        - Tower Division: Believe spire to be "of prokatakos make", take frequent nearly-guaranteed-suicidal trips into the Heart.
-The Cathedral of our Glorious Lady:
    Spire Core page 155-157
        - Limyé, the light, Our Glorious Lady: Virtues of Tenacity and Community. Only legal facet to worship.
        - Lombre, the dark, _: Virtues of Grace and Vigilance? Illegal to worship.
        - Lekolé, the shadow, blood-moon, _: Virtues of Sagacity and Fury? Illegal to worship.
        - Cathedral: Generations of rebuilding have blurred its edges. Worshippers aim for maximal humility and temperance.
