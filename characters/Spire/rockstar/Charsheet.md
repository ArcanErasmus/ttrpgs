## Idol Abilities
### Life and Soul of the Party - Basic
People flock to be near you. `Once per session`, so long as there are people nearby and a place to have it, you can create an `instant gathering with dancing, games`, drinking, eating and chatting. The `party gives you mastery to persuade, deceive, or distract` actions performed within it.

### Glamour - Basic
Black magic and poise let you become whoever they want you to be. `Once per situation, choose an NPC`. Using a cocktail of charm, practiced poise and semi-legal black magic, you `change your appearance to represent their ideal partner`. You don’t get to determine what this looks like – it’s `entirely reliant on the person you’re targeting` – and you can `end the spell by scrubbing off whatever makeup` you’ve applied and `spending five minutes in front of a mirror` remembering what you look like. Whatever your target prefers, you’ll always look like you. If they’re obsessed with tall people, you’ll look taller; if they like aelfir, you’ll look as though there’s some aelfir blood in you; if they’re mad about one particular person, you’ll resemble them (but `not enough to, say, pass as them`).

INSTILL EMOTION. [Occult] Your art drives others
to excess. If you succeed at a Compel+Occult check
when you perform or exhibit your art for an hour
or more, you may drive a receptive crowd into one
of the following: debauched excess, utter sorrow
or mind-numbing ecstasy. You can’t direct them
past this.
