## BG
- Moms: Hildur and Stephanie
    - Hildur (aka "bigmom" or "vollmutter") is a Skaeling, the daughter of a Jarl, and was a whaler. Is now a woodsman because she didn't want to be away from Stephanie for long periods. Calls her wife "Stephling".
    - Stephanie (aka "smallmom" or "mutterchen") is a Nordlander, devout Rhyan, and homemaker. Rhya answered her prayers to bless them with a beautiful and healthy child, who is a little much for her to handle at times. Sometimes calls her wife "Volldur" as a pun on "Voll-" + "Hildur" and "boulder".
