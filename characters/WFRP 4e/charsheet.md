-3 Ag, gain Iron Will talent
    - Info, Rhya's Cauldron
        - revered by astromancer (azyr/blue), druid (ghyran/jade), spiriter (shyish/amethyst) colleges
        - righteous in ideals, merciful to innocent. relentless in pursuit of justice, can become careless and callous to lives/well-being of others
    - Ascendant sign, The Drummer (surface level appearance)
        - nothing in moderation, expansive and generous spirit, never fails to give alms or care for family. can turn to excess/hedonism if unchecked
    - Celestial mansions
        - Sense (how a person expresses their emotions) The Limner's Line
            only expresses genuine emotions when certain of the impact they will have, tends to pick apart own faults
        - Trials (how someone responds to adversity, what they tend to struggle with) The Piper
            struggles with trust, tends to use deception and cunning as a first response
        - Thought (thought processes, how someone communicates) Dragomas the Drake
            defaults to a leadership role, operates better when managing and delegating than when taking orders
        - Love (attitude towards interpersonal relationships, including familial and romantic) Wymund the Anchorite
            analytical and patient, commits slowly to a relationship. once someone is "in", will overlook a lot of shortcomings
        - Coin (a person's relationship with money and material goods) The Drummer
            spends freely, investing in trappings and giving charity in equal measure
    - Personality summary
        - Leads with advice and cunning, positioning themself as a wise and mysterious mentor. Free with money, they give and purchase with the surety of someone who knows either boundless wealth or expects to never reach retirement. Quick to turn conversations away from themself, it's rare that they offer meaningful information about themself, and rarer still when it's truthful. Only after long cooperation or closeness will they begin to open up, as they struggle not to leave the door open for a quick and silent cutting of ties. Getting close reveals they are righteous and merciful almost to a fault, and level true criticism at themself first and foremost.
