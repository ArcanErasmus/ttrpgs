## Short Bio
- Moms: Hildur and Stephanie
    - Hildur (aka "bigmom" or "vollmutter") is a Skaeling, the daughter of Jarl Nikolas, and was a whaler. Is now a woodsman because she didn't want to be away from Stephanie for long periods. Calls her wife "Stephling". 24 years older than ?.
    - Stephanie (aka "smallmom" or "mutterchen") is a Nordlander, devout Rhyan, and homemaker. Rhya answered her prayers to bless them with a beautiful and healthy child, who is a little much for her to handle at times. Sometimes calls her wife "Volldur" as a pun on "Voll-" + "Hildur" and "boulder". 19 years older than ?.
- Siblings:
    - ? (male), 6 years older: ?
    - ? (female), 1 year older: We are always at each other's throats in that sibling love/hate way. She is definitely jealous of us twins' dynamic (sorry sis!)
    - ? (female), fraternal twin: My partner in crime
    - ? (male), 9 years younger: Baby bro! Protect him!

## Appearance
- Wavy red hair pulled back into a small ponytail
- Wears a rugged patchwork of assorted pelts and cloths
- Packs light, but has a pair of fighting axes flanking her waist

## Personality
- Where are you from?
Hargendorf, Nordland. My Norscan family hails from Clan Arnorung, of the Skaeling tribe.
- What is your family like?
My vollmutter is fun and encourages me to seek adventure, while my mutterchen is wise and attempts to instill a sense of self-preservation. My fraternal twins Linnea, Willibert, and Heilwig are pursuing their own careers closer to home.
- What was your childhood like?
I was the terror of the town, first in mischief, then as I grew older, in romance and heartbreak (and still mischief).
- Why did you leave home?
It was time to set out, like any good Norscan child, and seek glory to rival my great-great-grandfather Jarl Arnor.
- Who are your best friends?
I loved everyone back home, but my favorite person was Wanda, the elderly priest of Rhya. She always stuck up for me, and taught me the importance of the Earth Mother.
- What is your greatest desire?
To become head of my own clan, with many loving partners. While dying in battle would be noble, I'd far rather pass away peacefully in the arms of my lovers.
- What are your best and worst memories?
?
- What are your religious beliefs?
Rhya is responsible for my life and my lack of parenthood burdens. In her stead, I will protect the weak and the earth. In contrast, the War-God teaches strength in battle and glory in a violent death. To this end, bringing fury and giving love are both intimately pious acts. Other hints of the Northern Gods have trickled into my practices, wholly reinterpreted through an Imperial lens. Nurgle: His "blessings" of plague and famine are to be treated with utmost seriousness, lest they touch you or your loved ones, and are a sure sign of the gods' disfavor. Tzeentch: Magic is to be treated with fear and respect, and an offering to the powers that be should be made before any journey at sea (even a quick prayer before a swim is wise). Slaanesh: Everything in moderation, even moderation. For the last part, this generally means I try to only indulge in one thing at a time.
- To whom, or what, are you loyal?
1. Her Norscan heritage
2. Her own needs and beliefs
3. Her friends
4. Her employers
- Why are you adventuring?
To seek glory, and see the world.
