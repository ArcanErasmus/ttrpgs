Luliana is riding in the late evening with her business partner and sorta-boyfriend Gasparo Sal. We are headed through a forest path to Marienberg, and he is driving the cart. We are in the middle of an argument over his depression and drinking, and my harassing him over it, when some beasts? beastmen? bandits? emerge from the treeline. The ambush seems poorly timed, as they are slightly too late to encircle us. Gasparo hands me the reins and moves to fend off the attackers, while Luliana tries to speed us through this mess. As it becomes clear that Gasparo can't hold them off forever, she gives him a shove from behind, toppling him off the cart and leaving him as a sacrificial offering. Luliana rides hard into the night, not stopping until she reaches the shelter of Marienberg.

# Luliana's Views
- On poor folk
    - If all they do is go through the motions, day in and day out, are they any different from livestock? I've seen oxen with more focus and drive than their masters.
- On rich folk
    - Rivals. Thankfully, most of them are stupid, and can be parted from their resources if you are careful. The danger is that they like to band together when scared, and it becomes impossible to take them head on.
- On nobility
    - 99% of them were born into their status, and sit fat and lazy upon their thrones. Were the world just, I would topple them and make them suffer the injustices they dish out on those like me who dare to reach for more.
- On other races
    - Interactions between races cause conflict. Conflicts are opportunities to be the winner.
- On religion
    - A form of contentment. The people always beg the gods for the smallest scrap of a handout. If you're going to try and get something from them, you need leverage.
- On her hometown
    - A horrible place where those with a fraction more power would mercilessly abuse those with less. Luliana escaped there by seizing opportunity. In her most miserable, and recurring, nightmare, she loses her wealth and ends up back there, mocked and beaten by the same bullies of her youth.
- On her family
    - They might as well be strangers. They had ambitions, but waited too long to act on them. They serve Luliana as a lesson in the dangers of contentment.
- On Cythara
    - Luliana definitely received quite the fright at first, but her strange powers have some serious potential. She will need to be kept on a tight leash.
- On her current status
    - The world doesn't want her to succeed, but she will anyway. She is dangerously insecure in her financial and social position, so she has to fight tooth and nail to keep moving. If she slows down, she would surely be swept away.
- On her current conditions
    - She smells stagnation, and it makes her real antsy. She would sell her wagons and horses and fire her drivers in a heartbeat if she found an investment that she could milk harder.
- Quotes
    - "Opportunity only 'knocks' if you are too blind to see it coming."
    - "You won't get the good end of any deal unless you negotiate from a position of power, or the appearance of one."
    - "To slow down is to compromise. Compromise leads to failure. Failure breeds contentment. And to be content, is to die."
