# Vinse's Journal

## Backstory
- Fighting dog
    - Raised for a fighting ring, lots of (intentional) neglect and abuse
    - On a few rare occasions, I was shown kindness by my owner's children. They once took some of the worse off dogs away, but then never returned. My owner was extremely angry when that happened. I assume he did not let them return when he learned of what they did.
    - Awakened when mysterious drugs were mixed into food, with intent of increasing aggression
    - Attacked and killed owner in a bloody struggle, took the keys he used to defend against me
- Ideal: Might
    - In the ring, raw tenacity was everything. If you hesitate, or don't give it your all, you might be killed before the humans stop the fight
    - If you can't lick your own wounds and keep them clean, you might die of neglect or horrible "treatments"
    - With the world thrown into chaos, strength is necessary for survival
    - However, others have lived in groups, and show affection. Maybe this is strength? Maybe this is a better recipe for survival?
    - The humans no longer control our survival. We don't have to fight for them. Maybe a future can be had without such sadistic competitions?
- Bonds
    - Keys: My owner used his keys to inflict particularly nasty wounds on dogs who misbehaved, lost fights, or simply caught his sight when he was in a rage or on drugs. I keep them on me as a reminder of the cruelty that humans can inflict, and how all dogs share a connection in our weakness to them.
    - Spiked Collar: The collar provides the closest thing to safety that a dog could hope for in a fight. To not have a collar invites a swift death.
    - Rubber Chunk: Torn off of a car tire, it was the only non-living thing I could attack with my full strength and not hurt myself. While not a healthy habit to continue, the emotional release of biting down hard on it provides me with some comfort and sanity. If I can't indulge in that vice, the urge starts to take over me.
- Flaws
    - Fleeting memories of affection: The brief pleasant encounters with the owner's children have left me longing for more such companionship. I was never allowed physical closeness to other fight dogs except in the ring. I was able to see other dogs on the outside, and now that I am out, such a world is alien and terrifying. I need a pack, but they need to be trustworthy.
