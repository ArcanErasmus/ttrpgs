# Grand Cosmic Plan That The Universe Has For Me
- Why did I fall in with this group?
- Why was there a merchant to send us out to the docks?
- Why were we spirited away to some spidery cavern?
    - Coins lead me onwards, suggesting I am on the right path.
    - The bottle of liquid must be important. I bet it is meant to lead me to some elf.

- Here is how "Szetszei" is derived:
    - "Sz" from "Szehsha", meaning "family lineage or holdings"
    - "et" from "Netzus", meaning "divided/scattered"
    - "szei" as the 3rd-person non-possessive pronoun
    - The combination was made to mean "Loner/Solo [from the] Divided House"
