## Backstory
- TODO

## Quest Log
- Task: Find missing merchant's employees
    - Docks, fairly empty due to promising fishing opportunities
    - Markings of "unsafe house/floor"?
    - Take canoe out to boathouse


# Grand Cosmic Plan That The Universe Has For Me
- Why did I fall in with this group?
- Why was there a merchant to send us out to the docks?
- Why were we spirited away to some spidery cavern?
    - Coins lead me onwards, suggesting I am on the right path.
    - The bottle of liquid must be important. I bet it is meant to lead me to some elf.
