## Quest Log
- Task: Find the missing employees of Antonin Kirolov, merchant
    - We began headed to the docks, which were pretty empty due to rumors of plentiful fishing opportunities
    - Taking a canoe out towards the boathouse, we were all knocked out by some magic before we could get there
    - Waking somewhere in a cave system, I freed myself from spider webbing and rounded up the others
    - Swarmed by giant phase spiders and their skull-nesting spawn, we carried a fighting retreat into an old guardhouse of sorts
    - The guardpost was home to Kiki Ankleshanker, a goblin paladin hiding there, as well as a complex and very lethal mechanism for keeping intruders from further below
    - After rescuing Sinala, wisps went nuts from some crystal being smashed
    - Found some lady in very old-styled clothing, barely alive, does magic, speaks Elven, "Forgotten name" (doubt), calling her "Karile"
    - Barely surviving repeated zaps by a pile of wisps, our collection of 14 members + cat
    - Found our way out. Final tally: 12 + cat alive, 2 "reborn", 1 dead
    - "Markoff Dimholder", week ago, wrote about infestations here

- Here is how "Szetszei" is derived:
    - "Sz" from "Szehsha", meaning "family lineage or holdings"
    - "et" from "Netzus", meaning "divided/scattered"
    - "szei" as the 3rd-person non-possessive pronoun
    - The combination was made to mean "Loner/Solo [from the] Divided House"
