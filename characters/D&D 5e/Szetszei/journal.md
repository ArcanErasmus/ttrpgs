## Quest Log
- Task: Find the missing employees of Antonin Kirolov, merchant
    - We began headed to the docks, which were pretty empty due to rumors of plentiful fishing opportunities
    - Taking a canoe out towards the boathouse, we were all knocked out by some magic before we could get there
    - Waking somewhere in a cave system, I freed myself from spider webbing and rounded up the others
    - Swarmed by giant phase spiders and their skull-nesting spawn, we carried a fighting retreat into an old guardhouse of sorts
    - The guardpost was home to Kiki Ankleshanker, a goblin paladin hiding there, as well as a complex and very lethal mechanism for keeping intruders from further below
    - After rescuing Sinala, wisps went nuts from some crystal being smashed
    - Found some lady in very old-styled clothing, barely alive, does magic, speaks Elven, "Forgotten name" (doubt), calling her "Karile"
    - Barely surviving repeated zaps by a pile of wisps, our collection of 14 members + cat
    - Found our way out. Final tally: 12 + cat alive, 2 "reborn", 1 dead
    - "Markoff Dimholder", week ago, wrote about infestations here
    - Objectives
        - Main: Rescue Sinala the minotaur apprentice (found)
        - Main: Rescue Nibe the kobold lamplighter (found)
        - Main: Rescue Otlu the Yuan-ti clerk (found)
        - Side: Rescue Chico the cat (found)
        - Side: Rescue Kiki the paladin (found)
        - Side: Rescue Kehabe the triton (found)

        - Side: Rescue Fuin'golp the weird grung (found)
        - Side: Rescue Sinala's sister (NOT FOUND)
- Dating Mithras
    - Temple to HOLLOW
        - Awkwardly climbed up there with a ladder after failing to scale the rope
        - (Mithras just flew up there)
        - Attempted to teach Dragonchess, but too tipsy and nervous to do a good job
        - Takkun (Mithras's familiar, alley sprite/chuh-what-a?)
- Rediscovering Madame Karile, amnesiac human lady
    - Known date: "5th Dawn, 1173"
        - Obsolete measure of time used by humans who first built a settlement atop the Twist
        - A derivative system is used by the predominantly-human kingdoms of the Tiger Emperors
    - Familiar landmark: Religious district, statue of a 6-limbed drow
        - Effigy in a shrine to GRAIN, Gods of Things Left Behind
        - Karile knows about GRAIN, but remembers Lolth with a deep adoration and respect
        - "Lolth, a god of elves"
            - Drow goddess of whispers, ambition, darkness, and drow
            - The reason that drow society is classically matriarchal
            - Premier goddess of the underdark, a great catacomb that once stretched across the world
            - A cruel and spiteful goddess, but after a time of great change in the heavens and earth, she shepherded people to places like GR, so that they find safety
            - Her petition to GRAIN was to perpetually shroud GR in a faint cloud cover, allowing her people to walk amongst the daylight without harm
            - In the end, her cruel flame was spent, leaving only her love for her malicious and vain children, who could not remain in the underdark, for it was taken over by things worse than them
            - Effigies of her still adorn shrines to GRAIN
    - Familiar interest: music
        - Not familiar with Grung throat-singing
    - 
- Task: Count Rene Markham, Party Gone Wrong
    - Hobgoblin, fancy cane, funny colored hair
        - Adventurous arms merchant, just returned from lands of the twin emperors of faraway continents
        - Contracts voided by twin emperors, arrested on suspicion of being a spy
        - Released after petitioning from his spouse, who in return for pulling some strings, attended a gala
    - Returned to some terrible tragedy, a party at Duke DeMourne's estate in Naiad's Vault, which ended in disaster
        - Spouse went to this party, mansion of the DeMourne family, Count tried to break in to find her
        - Nobody returned from this (and there were a lot of nobles there!)
    - No one's been in or out in a month
        - Inquisition all over it, blocked off, but their presense has been dwindling

    - Infiltrating the estate
        - Orange glowing flowers
        - Spontaneous pumpkins, black veins
        - Spooky fireplace eats Unseen Servants to light
        - Darkvision, and light sources brought from outside, don't work
        - "Shadows" (type of ghost, very bad?)
        - Being frightened makes weird things happen
        - *Burning maid, Tereza*: needs water
            - Washbasin in study downstairs, right off the main hall
        - *Closet ghost*: lost?
