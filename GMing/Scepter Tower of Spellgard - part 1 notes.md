# Scepter Tower of Spellgard - part 1
## Overview
- "30-40 hrs"
- Ideal for lvl 2, takes chars up to lvls 4-5

## GM notes
- Pacing is key, keep play moving (ignore advice on being too fast, we are always slow)
- Give appropriate hints; always indicate conditions/bloodied on opponents
- Leveling mid-adventure is OK
- Half XP for failing an encounter (combat or skill challenge), if they beat it later then give the other half (personally I would award more, you learn more from failure)
- Char death: 500gp plus Raise Dead ritual, 20% more if hiring someone to cast it for them (or let it be meaningful, it's on the party)
- Milestones: only XP encounters count, happens after every 2nd encounter since extended rest

## The Adventure Hook
### Each character has a question they wish to ask Lady Saharel
- Can I adapt this? I don't feel that characters *have* this burning need (perhaps Sinnafein does)
### Segue out of prev adventure
- No longer extremely welcome in the city, and uncomfortable besides
- ...NPC escort quest???
    - Hiring the party bc they have a question they NEED answered
    - Half cash upfront, PCs can have all the rewards

## TODO
- Learn more abt Lost Netheril
    - Geography
- Create NPC slaveholder of Tara
    - Donald Mournhell, a male human explorer
- Create geographical bridge to new region

## The Adventure
### Welcome to the Adventure
- Players brave a fortress of Lost Netheril, for treasure and Lady Saharel's prophecy
    - Lady Saharel appears occasionally within the ruins
    - One of few structures standing after Spellgard's fall
- Combat heavy, but social is useful

### The Fallen Lands
- Last remnant of Netheril on western edge of the Anauroch (a desert)
- Spellplague caused lots of destruction, especially in the Fallen Lands
- Terrain: ridges and low foothills, scrubby pine stands, barren plateaus
    - Lots of fault lines and fissures make navigation difficult, ridges force circuitous routes, few vantage points
    - Streams, but low rainfall, in the summer, and winter is mild

#### Facts every adventurer knows
- Near the center of the Fallen Lands is Stormkeep, a mysterious castle surrounded by magical squalls of electricity
- Lots of orcs and goblin tribes, who war frequently between each other
- Day travel is relatively safe, save for a few bold bandits
- Explorers speak of the Plateau of the Reverse Obelisks, which is safe during the day but foolish to make camp in or near. It makes a safe approach to Spellgard
- Spellgard is atop a ridge on the eastern edge of the Fallen Lands, it's visible from miles away
- Spellgard was once known as Saharelgard. It is home to Lady Saharel, a ghost who speaks prophecy of the future or insight of the past
- At the edge of Spellgard stands the Monastery of the Precipice. Treasure-hunters and seekers after Lady Saharel congregate here

#### Rumors
- Orcs on the march, set to take Spellgard within a month (time pressure), will use it as a staging ground to supply to assault Gray Vale
- Widowed noble at Monastery wants to pay to retrieve husband's body for burial
- Half-finished castle in Fallen Lands is haunted by ghost of the lord who died before it could be finished
- Many great treasures of Spellgard were taken when the fortress was ransacked, but rumors of undisturbed chambers persist
- Castle never truly abandoned: Treasure and prophecy seekers above, and kobolds and others below
- In the middle of Spellgard is Scepter Tower, it's said that no living being can pass within its walls
- Netheril magic lingers in the ruins, focused on Scepter tower
* Recent dark rumors from the Monastery claim a dangerous presence has established itself in recent weeks, and many prophecy seekers have vanished in the ruins
- Other seeker camps (outside the Monastery) dot the ruins

### What brings the PCs here?
- Prophecy is infrequent and often requires an extended stay, making it worthwhile to only those most determined
- Hired as escort/guards for a desperate seeker
- Have business (of any sort) with another seeker

### Introduction
- Many wander the ruins, rebuilding parts in hope it entices her (though nobody knows if any method will achieve any results)
- A shadar-kai adept named Thoran seized the Scepter Tower, his servants scour the ruins for alabaster pillars as arcane focusing devices. Once Thoran has eight of them, he plans to summon and bind Lady Saharel to his will. Access to limitless prophecy would make him a large threat to the world beyond
- The tower is said to have only one, easily defended, extremely fortified entrance, but the PCs will discover another way in beneath a rampart wall: through the catacombs
- PCs must fight through the catacombs and then up the tower

### Background
- Sorceress of Saharel, became a lich to survive the collapse of Netheril
- Used to answer questions on the history of Netheril for anyone who would rebuild part of the fortress ruins
- After Spellplague, became both more reclusive and distant, and more powerful
- Appears only rarely, to answer single questions by seekers
- She is not infallible, especially wrt the future
- Almost 40 years ago a wanderer named Kuryon came through searching for treasures. Found Saharel by accident, she told him something, and then he built the Monastery of the Precipice
- Kuryon and his initiates have written down lore and philosophy in the slim book *The Analects of Kuryon* which speaks of the Lady's prophecies
- The Analects was read by Thoran, a shadar-kai who was once an apprentice to a Shadowfell sage cabal. Thoran was exiled for stealing forbidden tomes from them, and decided to seek out the Lady and bind her for unlimited prophecy.
