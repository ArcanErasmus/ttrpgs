# Discussions in the comments
1. To fix TWF, instead combine Improved with Double Slice, and Greater with TW Rend. In addition, Improved TWF further reduces penalties by 2
2. Eliminate full-attack actions as a concept. All classes are entitled to their full iterative attacks as part of an attack action. "If a wizard can bend space and time and still move, why does a fighter need to sit still to be effective?"
3. Add grapple to Powerful Maneuvers

# My further ideas
1. Eliminate IUS. Instead, grant the benefits to anyone that has a feat which normally uses IUS as a prerequisite. If a class feature would give IUS as a bonus feat, instead it gives a bonus feat that has IUS as a prerequisite, that you meet the prerequisites for.
2. To reiterate the change in power attack/deadly aim/combat expertise: When attacking, can choose to take a scaling -X to hit/CMB. If you do so, choose either a +2X bonus to damage, or +X dodge bonus to AC. Eliminate Fighting Defensively, but no change needed to Total Defense.

3. Remove Rapid Reload, and just reduce reload times of all weapons by one step. Guns and crossbows are worse than bows primarily for the additional feat tax they require (not to mention lack of Str to damage), and this helps alleviate that.
4. Consider letting characters ignore Endurance, Run, and Shield Focus in prerequisite lists.
5. In the same vein as combat expertise/etc, consider making Dirty Fighting a built-in feature.
6. If eliminating the full-attack action, the Vital Strike line might be worthless. This isn't a problem, just something to note.
7. Deft/Powerful Maneuvers would have a prerequisite of +1 BAB. Combine Greater versions as well, and the Greater Deft/Powerful Maneuvers would have a prerequisite of the regular version and +6 BAB.

    - Evasion with a shield: Iron Guard feat.
    - Catch Off-Guard includes Throw Anything, and removes attack penalty for improvised weapons.
    - Deflect Arrows can be done with a shield if character has Sheild Focus.
    - Greater Shield Focus adds bonuses vs ranged touch attacks
    - Weapon Proficiency feat applies to a weapon group, no more Martial/Exotic weapon proficiency feats.
    - New combat maneuver: Hamstring. Entangles opponent for 1 rd +1 per 5 points CMD beat. Doesn't work vs creatures immune to crits, or using magical flight.
    - Combat Expertise/Power Attack options renamed to Defensive Stance/Risky Strike.
    - bunch of other stuff too
