# Custom Feat
## Half-Swording (Combat)
*You learn to grab the blade of your sword when needed, to exploit the limitations of heavy armor.*

### Prerequisites
- Weapon Focus (any weapon in the Heavy Blades group) or Combat Expertise, Base Attack Bonus +3

### Benefit:
- You can use a weapon in the heavy blades group for two special forms of attack. Both styles require the sword to be held in two hands, but you may only apply half your strength to damage, the sword's damage is reduced by one step (for example, a Medium longsword would deal 1d6 damage). You may only choose which form of attack to use at the start of your turn or when declaring an attack, and the effects last until the start of your next turn. Choosing to use one of these special styles imposes a -2 penalty to AC against melee attacks, as it makes parrying more difficult. Gripping the blade of your sword does not subject you to any extra effects from your own weapon, such as a flaming enchantment.
    - Half-Sword Thrust: By gripping the blade with your off-hand, you can aim for the gaps in a suit of armor. With this style, the sword does piercing damage, and you treat your opponent's armor bonus to AC as lower by 1 point + 1 point per four levels above first (maximum 5 at level 17), to a minimum of +0. If your opponent has no armor bonus to AC, you may apply this reduction to their natural armor bonus instead.
    - Mordhau: By flipping the sword around and gripping the blade with both hands, you can strike with the crossguard or pommel, dealing a resounding blow even through the heaviest of helmets. With this style, the sword deals bludgeoning damage, and a successful strike forces your opponent to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Strength modifier), or become staggered until the start of your next turn. If a creature is immune to extra damage from critical hits, it is not subject to this effect.
- Special: Even if Weapon Focus is used as the prerequisite, you can still use any applicable weapon, not just the one you chose with Weapon Focus.
