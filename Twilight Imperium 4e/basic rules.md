## Play Area
- Tokens of one color
- Command sheet of one color
    - Rules quick reference
    - Tactic pool - how you get things done in the galaxy
    - Fleet pool - how large each of your fleets can be
    - Strategy pool - how many strategies you can participate in during the strategy cards section 
    - Trade goods pool
- Your faction sheet
    - Your abilities
    - Your units
    - Your commodity value
- Your faction cards

## Units and Systems
### How they interact with the map
- Structures and infantry are placed on planets
- Capital ships and fighters placed in the space area

### What they do
- Capital ships with capacity can carry fighters and infantry to other systems
- Fighters (and heavier ships) handle fleet combat
- Infantry capture planets
- Planetary defense structures defend planets
- Space docks make more units

### Planet Cards
- Name, Trait, Resources, Influence
- Resources let you build more things when you activate systems with space docks
- Influence lets you get more command tokens to place on your sheet and produce more boats during the Agenda Phase
- *Planet cards act like land cards in mtg, letting you "tap" (flip) them to use a value on them for an action*

## Playing Rounds
### Basic Structure
- First, choose a strategy card in the Strategy Phase
- Play through the Action Phase, each person taking a single action until everyone passes the round
- Then, clean up and reset everything in the Status Phase for the next round
- At some point during the game, the Agenda Phase is added at the end, where you `TODO`

### The Action Phase
- Choose between Component Action, Tactical Action, Strategic Action

#### Component Action
- Whenever something you have in front of you (faction sheet, card, something in your hand) says "ACTION:"
- Do that action

#### Tactical Action
- Take a token from the Tactic Pool and place it on a system, activating that system
- Everything that follows happens relating to that system
    - Can move units into that system from an adjacent one
    - If you move space units into a system with another player's units, or try to take a planet with another player's ground forces, you have to participate in combat
    - Can build from space docks in that system
- Cannot choose a system you already have a token on, so you can't double down on a system (or choose one locked by Diplomacy or other methods)

#### Strategic Action
- Might be the most important action you do during the round
- *Must* be performed during the round for each strategy card you have (usually one) that round
- To perform your Strategic Action
    - Do the Primary Ability effects on the card
    - Then, each other player in turn order can choose to perform the Secondary Ability
    - Lastly, flip the card so it is clearly used
- Strategy Card also determines your initiative for the round for both the Action Phase and Status Phase

##### Quick Overview of All Strategy Cards
1. Leadership
    - Primary: Get more command tokens, spend influence for even more
    - Secondary: Spend influence for more command tokens
    - Take this when you need to go first this round
    - Take this when you need more actions this round and can't spend a ton of influence for them
2. Diplomacy
    - Primary: Lock out a system with a planet you control, then refresh 2 planet cards you control
    - Secondary: Spend strategy to refresh 2 planet cards you control

    - Take this when you need to control the tempo of your planet refreshes to maximize their value
    - Take this to stop someone blocking a system they control
3. Politics
    - Primary: Change who the speaker is, then draw 2 action cards, then scry 2 on the agenda deck
    - Secondary: Spend strategy to draw 2 action cards
    - Take this when you want to push an agenda, or deny the influence of an agenda
    - Take this when you want to choose your strategy card first next turn
4. Construction

    - Secondary: Spend strategy to place a structure

    - Primary: Redistribute your command tokens, perform a tactical action without placing a token, then redistribute your command tokens

7. Technology
    - Primary: Research a tech, then spend 6 resources to research a tech
    - Secondary: Spend strategy and 4 resources to research a tech
    - Take this when you want to research multiple techs, or can't afford 4 resources for it
