# Common Mistakes
1. Combat is non-optional, no matter the negotiations present, but abilities that involve dice are optional
    Space Cannon, Anti-Fighter Barrage, and Bombardment are optional, and you can negotiate the use of those
2. Only a single secret objective that happens during the action phase can be scored in a single combat
3. The Leadership strategy secondary doesn't cost a command token
4. Fleet-size-per-hex restrictions only apply to main ships. Fighters are carried by the capacity of other ships and don't count
    Upgraded fighters that can move independently are tracked by this limit however
5. Production Capacity is different than Production Cost. The former is the quantity of physical plastic tokens that can be made, and the latter is what it costs you to get them
6. The system you activate is the destination, not origin, of any movement that happens
7. The Warfare secondary is only a single space dock in your home system, not all of them combined (unlike a tactical action production)
8. Production happens during the same tactical action as movement, including bringing in certain faction ships with a production capacity and then immediately using it
9. If you have passed during the action phase, you can still perform non-component action cards (things that affect other players during their own action phases)
10. Can still to strategy secondaries after having passed
11. Can perform start-of-turn effects before passing (e.g. activate legendary planet, make deal with another player, then pass without taking an Action)
12. Diplomacy primary needs to be used on a system that the activating player controls, and the tokens that get placed on it come from reinforcements not the command sheet
13. Two non-active players cannot resolve transactions. They can still chat and theoretically make verbal deals, but nothing can change hands
14. Relics cannot be traded. Relic fragments, trade goods, commodities, and up to a single promissory note (on each side) can be traded, and both the active player and whoever they are dealing with can exchange those
15. The active player can only perform a single transaction with each other player per turn
16. Spend objectives need to have the resources spent on the objective at the moment the objective is being scored, not during any earlier phase
17. Each person can score each public objective, not just the first person to get to it
18. "When agenda revealed" abilities happen before "After agenda revealed"
19. Order of operations difference between action phase and agenda/strategy phase. In the action phase, the initiative order is used to resolve simultaneous abilities. In the strategy phase or agenda phase, resolve simultaneous abilities in speaker order, starting with the speaker
20. Unit upgrade cards don't give any symbols for prereqs
21. Fighters and infantry have two unit symbols next to their cost, meaning you get two of them per one Resource cost spent on them. However, that still counts as two pieces of plastic being created for the purpose of Production value
22. Just to hammer home - Production value is how many pieces of plastic can be made, and you must spend your Resources to pay the Cost of all of those things you are making
23. When an ability asks you to "produce" something, this is NOT the same as activating the Production ability, especially for the purposes of things that ping off that
24. Retreating from combat is not a draw, you are considered the loser. Only the "Skilled Retreat" action card is a draw
25. You can only retreat into a system that has your ships, or no ships at all AND at least one planet you control, or (with dark energy tap) no other player's units. When you retreat into a system, you place a token from your reinforcements onto it (locking it down but not activating it)
26. Announcing a retreat doesn't skip combat, you still have to fight one more time before moving to retreats
27. Promissory notes that go face up into your play area cannot be traded, but ones that you take to your hand can
28. Non-neighbors can participate in transactions during the agenda phase, while only neighbors can do so during the action phase
29. Losing control of your homeworld only stops you from scoring public objectives, not Mecatol Rex scoring, or secret objective scoring
30. When replenishing command tokens, all tokens on the board go into your reinforcements, then you get two from reinforcements to your command board
31. Using a planet for its technology specialty exhausts the planet
