# ?'s Spellbook - Miscellaneous
## SLAs
- SLAs have no verbal, somatic, focus, or material components
- Reactivating a constant SLA is a swift action
- SLAs are standard actions that provoke AoO, unless stated otherwise

### Faerie Fire - evocation [light], lvl 1
|------------|--------------
| Range      | long
| Area       | creatures/objects within 5 ft radius burst
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | yes
A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by *faerie fire* take a -20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), *blur*, *displacement*, *invisibility*, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light.

The *faerie fire* can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The *faerie fire* does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

### Sanctuary - abjuration, lvl 1
|------------|--------------
| Range      | touch
| Target     | creature touched
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl
| Save       | Will neg
| SR         | no
Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can’t follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can’t directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act.

### Nondetection - abjuration, lvl 3
|------------|--------------
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | constant
You are difficult to detect by divination spells such as *clairaudience/clairvoyance*, *locate object*, and *detect* spells. *Nondetection* also prevents location by such magic items as *crystal balls*. If a divination is attempted against the you or an item in your possession, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 15 + your caster level.
