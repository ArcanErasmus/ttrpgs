# Custom Race - Imperial Goblins (10 RP)
## Lore
- Where does your race tend to live and why?
    - Imperial Goblins are those that have integrated into the Acyran Empire, and mix easily with Elves and the other common races.
- What does your race look like? How does the members’ appearance help them adapt to their typical environment?
    - Nearly indistinguishable from tribal Goblins, their large heads lead to a somewhat childlike appearance in the eyes of larger races. This tends to garner sympathy and make friendship come easy.
- What is your race’s history? Does it have a creation myth? Were there pivotal events in the race’s history?
    - (No contributions made here)
- What kinds of relationships does your race have with other races? Does it have allies? Competitors? Enemies? Hated foes?
    - No contributions made here, except to note that Goblins are gregarious and quick to integrate themselves into a group if given the opportunity.

- Other Traits
    - Curiosity, **4 RP**
        - Goblins are naturally inquisitive about the world around them. They gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) become class skills for them.

    - Low-light Vision, **1 RP**
        - Long since adapted to surface life, Goblins of the Empire still retain some of their keen night vision.
    - Master Tinker, **2 RP**

    - Multitalented, **2 RP**
        - Quick studies but tending to languish when forced to focus on only one thing, Goblins flourish when spreading their learning across multiple subjects. They choose two favored classes at 1st level, gaining the favored class bonus whenever they take a level in either class.

## Alternate Racial Traits
- Enclave Protector, **2 RP**
    - Some Goblins prefer more tightly-knit groups, and their fierce protectiveness of their friends manifests supernaturally. They add +1 to the caster level of any abjuration spells they cast. They also gain the following spell-like abilities, using their character level as the caster level:
        - Constant: *nondetection*
        - 1/day: *faerie fire*, *obscure object*, *sanctuary*
    This trait replaces Master Tinker.
- Large Ears, **2 RP**
    - Goblins' ears, while somewhat dulled by the relative cacophony of city life, pick up a much larger range of pitches, and are superior in pinpointing sources of sound. Combined with their sharp eyes, it's hard to pass things by their notice, giving them a +2 racial bonus to Perception checks. This trait replaces Multitalented.
- Magehunter, **4 RP**
    - For some Goblins, arcane magic is easily understood, but only because it causes unique and somewhat uncomfortable sensations. This additional sense, while not enough to actively detect nearby magic, gives a +2 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify a spell being cast. The discomfort leads to a natural disdain for such magic, and their quick response to these feelings affords Goblins a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against arcane spallcasters. This bonus does not apply against creatures that only use spell-like abilites, rather than actual spells. This trait replaces Curiosity.

## Favored Class Options
- Alchemist: Add +1/2 to the number of bombs per day the alchemist can create.
