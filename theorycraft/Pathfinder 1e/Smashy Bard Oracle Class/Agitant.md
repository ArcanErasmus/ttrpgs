## Class Features
All of the following are class features of the agitant.

### Weapon and Armor Proficiency
Agitants are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

### Agitantic Performance
An agitant is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects on those around them, including themself if desired. They can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + their Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st an agitant can use agitantic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the agitant can produce any one of the types of agitantic performance that they has mastered, as indicated by their level.

Starting an agitantic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing an agitantic performance from one effect to another requires the agitant to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. An agitantic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the agitant is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. An agitant cannot have more than one agitantic performance in effect at one time.

At 7th level, an agitant can start an agitantic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, an agitant can start an agitantic performance as a swift action.

Each agitantic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.

If an agitantic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the agitant for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf agitant has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use an agitantic performance with an audible component. If they fails this check, the attempt still counts against their daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to agitantic performances with audible components.

If an agitantic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the agitant for the performance to have any effect. A blind agitant has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use an agitantic performance with a visual component. If they fails this check, the attempt still counts against their daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to agitantic performances with visual components.

List of Agitantic Performances:

- Rallying Cry (Su)
At 1st level, an agitant can use performance to rally dispirited allies. Each round they make an Intimidate check. Any ally (including the agitant) within 30 feet may use this check in place of their own saving throw against fear and despair effects. Those already under a fear or despair effect can attempt a new save each round using the agitant’s Intimidate check. Rallying cry does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. This is a mind-affecting ability that uses audible components.

- Distraction (Su)
At 1st level, an agitant can use their performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, they makes a Perform (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the agitant (including the agitant themself) that is affected by an illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack may use the agitant’s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the Distraction is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it sees the Distraction, but it must use the agitant’s Perform check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.

- Inspiring Blow (Su)
At 1st level, an agitant roars their war-cries with each telling blow. When they confirm a critical hit, they can start this performance as an immediate action (ending any other performances). They gain temporary hit points equal to their Charisma modifier (if positive), and all allies within 30 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on their next attack roll prior to the start of the agitant's next turn. These temporary hit points remain until the agitant ends their performance.

- Inspire Courage (Su)
A 1st level agitant can use their performance to inspire courage in their allies (including themself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the agitant’s performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5th level, and every six agitant levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The agitant must choose which component to use when starting their performance.

- Inspire Competence (Su)
An agitant of 3rd level or higher can use their performance to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the agitant. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the agitant’s performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the agitant has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th).

Certain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as Stealth, and may be disallowed at the GM’s discretion. An agitant can’t inspire competence in themself. Inspire competence relies on audible components.

- Bladethirst (Su)
An agitant of 4th level or higher may use this performance to grant one weapon, one natural weapon, one end of a double weapon, or 50 items of ammunition of the same type within 30 feet a +1 enhancement bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 6th (maximum +5 at 18th level). These bonuses stack with existing bonuses and may be used to increase the item’s enhancement bonus up to +5 or to add any of the following weapon properties: defending, distance, ghost touch, keen, mighty cleaving, returning, shock, shocking burst, seeking, speed, or wounding. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before adding special abilities.

- Weird Words (Su)
At 6th level the agitant can start a performance that is always a standard action to speak up to one word per 4 agitant levels laden with sonic energy. Each word deals 4d6 points of sonic damage as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet. The agitant adds their charisma modifier on damage rolls with weird words. Multiple words that strike the same target stack into a single powerful attack, applying energy resistance and bonuses on damage rolls only once. The agitant can target all words at the same or different targets, but they unleash all words simultaneously. Each word costs 1 round of agitantic performance.

- Dirge of Doom (Su)
An agitant of 8th level or higher can use their performance to foster a sense of growing dread in their enemies, causing them to take become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the agitant’s performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the agitant continues the performance. The performance cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the targets are already shaken from another effect. Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it relies on audible and visual components.

- Inspire Greatness (Su)
An agitant of 9th level or higher can use their performance to inspire greatness in themself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting extra fighting capability. For every three levels an agitant attains beyond 9th, they can target one additional ally while using this performance (up to a maximum of four at 18th level). To inspire greatness, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the agitant. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target’s Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependent. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and it relies on audible and visual components.

- Berserkergang (Ex)
At 13th level, an agitant can inspire a rapturous battle trance that suppresses pain, stunning, and fear effects for one creature, plus one additional creature per three levels after 13th. Affected creatures also gain DR 5/— (DR 10/— against nonlethal damage); this benefit stacks with the damage reduction class ability of barbarians. This mind-affecting ability requires audible components.

- Frightening Tune (Sp)
An agitant of 14th level or higher can use their performance to cause fear in their enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the agitant perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the agitant’s level + the agitant’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save fails, the target becomes frightened and flees for as long as the target can hear the agitant’s performance. Frightening tune relies on audible components.

- Inspire Heroics (Su)
An agitant of 15th level or higher can inspire tremendous heroism in themself or a single ally within 30 feet. For every three agitant levels the character attains beyond 15th, they can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, all of the targets must be able to see and hear the agitant. Inspired creatures gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the targets are able to witness the performance. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability that relies on audible and visual components.

- Mass Bladethirst (Su)
An agitant of 18th level or higher can use their bladethirst performance to enhance the weapons of as many allies as desired within 30 feet. The bonus provided by this power is +4 if conferred on two allies, +3 for three allies, +2 for four allies, and +1 for five or more allies. The power granted to each weapon must be identical.

### Mystery
Each agitant draws upon a divine mystery to grant them additional class skills and other special abilities. This mystery can represent a devotion to one ideal, prayers to deities that support the concept, or a natural calling to champion a cause. For example, an agitant with the waves mystery might have been born at sea and found a natural calling to worship the gods of the oceans, rivers, and lakes, be they benign or malevolent. Regardless of its source, the mystery manifests in a number of ways as the agitant gains levels. An agitant must pick one mystery upon taking their first level of agitant. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.

### Agitant's Curse (Ex)
Each agitant is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The agitant’s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. An agitant’s curse is based on their agitant level plus one for every two levels or Hit Dice other than agitant. Each agitant must choose one of the following curses.

### Versatile Performance (Ex)
At 2nd level, an agitant can choose one type of Perform skill. They can use their bonus in that skill in place of their bonus in associated skills. When substituting in this way, the agitant uses their total Perform skill bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill’s bonus, whether or not they has ranks in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the agitant can select an additional type of Perform to substitute.

The types of Perform and their associated skills are: Act (Bluff, Disguise), Comedy (Bluff, Intimidate), Dance (Acrobatics, Fly), Keyboard Instruments (Diplomacy, Intimidate), Oratory (Diplomacy, Sense Motive), Percussion (Handle Animal, Intimidate), Sing (Bluff, Sense Motive), String (Bluff, Diplomacy), and Wind (Diplomacy, Handle Animal).

Advanced Versatile Performances

Beginning at 6th level, instead of selecting an additional skill with versatile performance, an agitant can choose an advanced versatile performance for one Perform skill they previously selected with versatile performance. Some advanced versatile performance options can be selected only if the agitant meets the option’s prerequisites.

- Expanded Versatility (Ex)
The agitant chooses one Perform skill that they has already selected with versatile performance. They adds one of the following skills to the list of skills that are associated with the chosen Perform skill for the purpose of the versatile performance ability: Bluff, Diplomacy, Disguise, Escape Artist, Handle Animal, Intimidate, Sense Motive, or Use Magic Device. This option can be selected multiple times, but no skill can be associated with the same Perform skill more than once.

- Martial Performance (Ex)
The agitant chooses one weapon belonging to a fighter weapon group that is associated with a Perform skill they has selected with versatile performance (see below). They gains proficiency with this weapon. If the agitant is already proficient with this weapon or later becomes proficient with it, they gains Weapon Focus with that weapon as a bonus feat instead. In addition, the agitant’s effective fighter level is equal to 1/2 their agitant level for the purpose of qualifying for feats that specifically select weapons from those Perform skills’ associated fighter weapon groups. The types of Perform skills and their associated fighter weapon groups are: Act (close, double), Comedy (flails, thrown), Dance (monk, spears), Keyboard Instruments (hammers, siege engines), Oratory (heavy blades, light blades), Percussion (close, hammers), Sing (close, natural), String (axes, bows), and Wind (monk, thrown).

- Masterpiece
The agitant gains an agitantic masterpiece, as if they were giving up a feat to learn it. They must meet the masterpiece’s prerequisites, and the masterpiece must list ranks in a Perform skill that the agitant has chosen with versatile performance as a prerequisite. This option can be selected multiple times.

### Well-Versed (Ex)
At 2nd level, the agitant becomes resistant to the agitantic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general. The agitant gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against agitantic performance, sonic, and language-dependent effects.

### Revelation
At 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th level, an agitant uncovers a new secret about their mystery that grants them powers and abilities. The agitant must select a revelation from the list of revelations available to their mystery. If a revelation is chosen at a later level, the agitant gains all of the abilities and bonuses granted by that revelation based on their current level. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a revelation is a standard action.

Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against these revelations is equal to 10 + 1/2 the agitant’s level + the agitant’s Charisma modifier.

### Laborer's Wrath (Su)
At 12th level, the agitant can touch one melee weapon as a standard action to grant it greater power to harm and destroy crafted objects. For 1 minute, whenever this weapon deals damage to constructs or objects, it bypasses hardness and damage reduction. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your agitant level (to a maximum of 10 times at 20th level).

### Final Revelation
At 20th level, an agitant learns the final revelation about their mystery, granting them amazing powers and abilities. The nature of these bonuses depends upon the agitant’s mystery.
