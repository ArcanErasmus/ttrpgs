## Spellsinger Replacement Archetype Packages
* Grenadier (Alchemist) - "1812 Overture"
    - Bombs, Throw Anything, bomb damage increases
    - This synergizes really well, and gives me something to do in combat
- Domain Servant (Cleric) - "Carroler" "Faith Singer but actually good"
    - Pair of domans with powers, domain spell slots
    - Need to look at domain powers before making a call
* Avenger (Paladin) - "Songhealer but actually good"
    - Smite evil, lay on hands, mercy, channel positive energy, divine bond
    - Hot damn this is good. Is this even an equal trade?
- Divine Guardian (Paladin) - ""
    - Detect Evil, Aura of Courage, spellcasting
    - Trade down in spellcasting for nice party utility/buffs
- Woodland Spellcaster (Ranger) - "Attenborough"
    - 2 skill points/lvl, wild empathy, spellcasting
    - Trade down in spellcasting for skill ranks and wild empathy? Could be real solid
- Heritage (Sorcerer) - "Eldritch Dirge"
    - Bloodline and all its trappings
    - Some spell stuff might be wasted, but maybe a few good options?
- Augmenter (Summoner) - "Songraiser"
    - 1st and higher lvl spells
    - Lose cantrips for access to weird Summoner list. Maybe workable deal?
* Hexen (Witch) - "Curseweaver"
    - Hexes
    - This would fix your action economy
- Blood of Magic (Adept Godling) - "Performer of Legends"
    - One cleric domain (use different stat?), weird divine trait thing
    - need to read the traits
    - Identical to Eldritch Godling package of same name
- Like My Father (Clever Godling) - ""
    - see above, but scion talents instead of divine traits
    - oh and don't get domain spells, so talents are probably better
    - really need to start reading these
    - Identical to Mighty Godling package of same name
- Death Master (Death Mage) - "Pale Speaker"
    - pale road, death bond
    - seems really cool!
- Dragon Kith (Dragonrider) - "Dusk Mage"
    - low-light vision, darkvision, spellcasting, one extra good save
    - downgrading spellcasting just for more vision seems weak, unless the sor/wiz list is better
    - the save upgrade could be really interesting tho
- Shadow Cunning (Shadow Assassin) - "Haunting Voice"
    - 4 class skills, 2 skill ranks/lvl, shadow style
    - hard to make the styles work
* Spirit Talker (Shaman) - "Spirit Caller"
    - 2 skill ranks, spirit companion
    - easily-replacable animal companion? fun *and* more buff targets!
* Temporal Rogue (Time Thief) - "Adjust Playback Speed"
    - Mote of Time at half number, Temporal Talents
    - Extreme weird utility!
* Student of Battle (War Master) - "Melodic Tactician"
    - 2 skill ranks, war master talents
    - battle tactics = bardic performance, so you could consider applying the talents that way!
