### Zealous Calm
Max 1
With a successful Pray test, you can enter a state of cold fury until all enemies in your line of sight are pacified, or you receive the Stunned or Unconscious condition. While subject to Zealous Calm, the only actions you may take are Ranged (Bow) tests if you have a bow and ammunition, Weapon Skill tests if otherwise, or Athletics Test to reach an enemy more quickly. Furthermore, using Ranged (Bow) against a target within Point Blank range may be considered to be a melee attack in close combat for the purpose of talents such as Furious Assault, and you inflict an additional wound on all such successful tests.
