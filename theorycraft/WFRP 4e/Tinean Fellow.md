## Homebrew Talents
### Disciple of Evolution
(same as the Tzeentchian talent Disciple of Change)
(when you mutate, roll twice and pick which one you get)

### Grandfather's Blessing
- Max: WPB
- Tests: Tests using this Talent
- When you would contract a disease (and no later!), you may spend a point of Resolve to force it into dormancy. When a disease is dormant, it causes no symptoms, and is not transmissible. If you have one or more diseases held dormant using this Talent, you may make an opposed Willpower/Endurance test to foist one on someone else, infecting them as normal and curing yourself. You may have a number of diseases held dormant this way up to your Toughness Bonus.
