# The Catch with Corruption
## The Problem
- Corruption is a resource that you always sit at your cap of. Since it is so hard to burn off, there is little to no significance in having a higher cap.
- Corruption is too easily gained (based on the world lore), and would result in constant and daily mutations of everyone around you.
- The roleplay impact of corruption is trivialized by intertwining both "exerting yourself" and "interacting directly with the Ruinous Powers".

## The Solutions
1. Introduce a new resource: Stress. Stress is calculated as and effectively replaces the current Corruption meter.
2. Taking a Dark Deal, miscasting with magic (other than "Dhar") give Stress. Interacting with Corrupting Influences gives Corruption.
3. Your Corruption cap is the higher of your TB or WPB.
4. Taking any downtime action removes 1 Stress.
5. New downtime action: Relax. Using any attribute or skill that you can convince your GM is narratively appropriate, make a Challenging (+0) Test to reduce your Stress. Remove Stress equal to your SL (min 1, even on a failure). This is in addition to the automatic 1 Stress loss for performing a downtime action.
6. A compliment to Dark Whispers, but for Stress, is Follow Your Gut. The GM gives you a course of action just like Dark Whispers, that removes 1 Stress when followed.
7. If you gain Stress above your cap, make a Challenging (+0) Cool Test. On a failure, lose stress equal to the SL you failed the Cool Test by, and pick one:
    a. Lose 1 corruption and roll a random Fight, Flee, or Freeze response
    b. Choose a Fight, Flee, or Freeze response
    c. Gain 1 corruption as you push yourself beyond your limits

### Fight, Flee, or Freeze:
- You immediately lash out, gaining a number of Rage conditions equal to the SL you failed the Cool Test by.
- You are overcome with terror, gaining a number of Broken conditions equal to the SL you failed the Cool Test by.
- You shut down, unable to process the situation, gaining a number of Stunned conditions equal to the SL you failed the Cool Test by.

### Condition: Rage
- This functions as Broken, except instead of requiring you to flee, you are required to pursue and attack the latest source of stress, as per the Hatred psychology trait.

## The Reasoning
- This makes Corruption more impactful, and your Corruption cap more relevant. With this comes a more true fear of the Ruinous Powers.
- GMs are not constantly incentivized to come up with countless Dark Whispers.
- Characters can push themselves for rerolls using a resource that is more persistent, and more actively manageable.
- The meaningful but not character-dooming consequences of overtaxing Stress offers a more sane option for negative fallout.
- Follow Your Gut has twofold benefits: First, the GM retains a tool for railroading the party in a way that makes it feel like their choice. Second, it lets Dark Whispers be more in line with their name - as cruel and cunning as your GM can devise.

## An Optional Narrative Extra
- When you would choose to gain a Corruption to avoid breaking under the pressures assailing you, consider how you next responded. What did you do? How did you hold yourself together?
- The path you chose should inform which of the Ruinous powers was whispering in your ear, or which you naturally gravitate towards. Should such information become relevant, keep this in mind.
