With your touch, you begin to exert your will over a magical item or magical mechanism. For the duration of the spell, you may attempt to suppress an item's curse, compel it to respond to a command word of your choosing, or otherwise circumvent barriers to its operation (such as racial limits). As a bonus action, you may make an ability check using your spellcasting ability, against a DC of 10 + the spell or effect's level, to achieve such an effect until the start of your next turn. This spell will not permanently alter an object's properties, with the original command word and deleterious effects returning at the start of your next turn. Furthermore, this spell cannot give an item abilities it did not have. The DM may feel free to increase the DC if you are attempting to overcome several barriers, or unusually complex ones.
