for worden:
- NC is inherently good, given the heat gen you will have, tho i doubt you'll get to use the fuel rod gun so maybe just stop at rank 2?
- Siege Specialist gives occasional versatility and survivability, but probably not enough to be worthwhile
- Technophile 3 would let you mount your own turret gun
for support:
- Bonded up to 3 is good in defense of shooter
- Leader could just let you slap out accuracy for them (not necessary tho, given you'll give lock on accuracy a lot)
- Spotter is absolutely necessary all the way to rank 3
- Black Thumb is only really useful at rank 3, for soothing the shooter's heat
