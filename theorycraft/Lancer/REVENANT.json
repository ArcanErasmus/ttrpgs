When activated, it goes through a two-stage process. First, an invisible ionizing beam is directed at a target, priming the air between the APAP-3's emitter and the target. After an imperceptible delay, the APAP-3 then generates a large electrical impulse, which immediately arcs along the ionized pathway to the target.","customDamageType":"Energy"},{"id":"pg_heavy_signature","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"GFIP-1","flavorDescription":"The Gravitational Flux Impulse Projector Mk. 1 is a prototype of Leto's, inspired by shipboard artificial gravity generators used in nearlight bolt maneuvers. When fired, it follows an invisible targeting laser to generate a gravitational impulse centered on a single target. The impulse momentarily directs gravity away from the targeting laser's contact point and intensifies it a thousandfold, resulting in an effect similar to an explosion without the debris and residue of one. However, as an experimental weapon of Leto's, this weapon requires field maintenance after each use, heavily limiting its firing cadence.","customDamageType":"Explosive"}],"gear":[{"id":"pg_dataplating","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"JO/ISS-12","customDamageType":null},{"id":"pg_wilderness_survival_kit","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"customDamageType":null},{"id":"pg_personal_drone","destroyed":false,"uses":0,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"Callisto","customDamageType":null}],"extendedWeapons":[null],"extendedGear":[null,null]},"mechs":[{"id":"1435ac8e-8a07-42c0-b33d-2b37d551ddc9","name":"Something
