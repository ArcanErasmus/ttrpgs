# New Scenario: Loot Train aka Caravan Ambush v2
## Background
As a warbandâ€™s caravan makes its way through the city, a rival warband seizes the opportunity for gold and plunder!

## Special Rules
- The player with the lower victory points will be Blue, roll off in case of a tie. Provide a token to represent Blue's Caravan
- Starting with Blue, players take turns placing a total of 11 cargo pieces in the "treasure zones". Only one piece can be placed in any "treasure zone". Not all "treasure zones" will have a cargo piece

## Cargo Pieces
- A Blue warrior ending their movement within 1" of a cargo piece can pick it up
- A Blue warrior that ends their movement within 1" of the caravan or another Blue warrior can transfer a held cargo piece. Cargo pieces cannot be removed from the caravan
- A Blue warrior can only hold 1 cargo piece at a time, Red warriors cannot pick up cargo pieces
- A Blue warrior may escape off the Blue Escape Zone table edge, taking any held cargo piece with them

## Deployment
- On turn 1, players will deploy one random combat group (and for Blue, the caravan) in their respective Deployment Zones.
- On turn 4, Blue will deploy one random combat group in the Blue Deployment Zone
- On turn 4, Red will deploy one random combat group in Red Backup Zone 2
- On turn 7, Blue will deploy one random combat group in the Blue Deployment Zone
- On turn 7, Red will deploy one random combat group in Red Backup Zone 1

## Deployment Map and Combat Zones

## The Caravan
- Unharmable
- Cannot climb
- Controlled by Blue
- Automatically moves 4" every turn toward the Blue Escape Zone table edge as directly as possible

## Fleeing
- Warriors flee toward the table edge of their deployment zone. If they reach the edge, they rally

## Winning
- When Blue's caravan exits the Blue Escape Zone edge, the match immediately ends
- Any cargo piece held by a Blue warrior or in the caravan when the game ends is controlled by Blue. All remanining cargo is controlled by Red
- If neither team Routed, the warband that controls the most cargo pieces wins
- If either side has 5 or more warriors OoA and/or escaped, it must make a Rout test at the beginning of each of its own turns
- If Red routs, Blue gets half of the unclaimed cargo, round down

## Exploration Dice
- +1 for winning the scenario
- +1 for being the warband with the least amount of VP in the campaign
- -1 for being the warband with the most amount of VP in the campaign
- +1 for each cargo piece controlled by the warband
