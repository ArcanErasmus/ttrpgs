# Najkurm's Journal

## Backstory
- Najkurm is the child of ?
    - left on his own to seek out a path, and burn the world
    - addicted to fire and its comfort
- where do i come in?
    - Najkurm was captured when he set out to commit yet more arson, but this time the guards were waiting for him. Offered a chance to surrender, he accepted life as a gladiator. He quickly fell in love with the attention from the crowds, finding he had a knack for showmanship. Najkurm earned the moniker "The Flaming Demon", and his fights drew massive crowds. He has since paid off his debts to the state, successfully arguing to officials that his popularity earns hefty revenues for the arena. While they allow him to earn and save his own money, Najkurm never asks to be let free, and they would never agree if he did.
    - Najkurm's parents discovered his location, and sent a package to him. It contained the family torch-maces, as well as a letter explaining their pride in him, for his devotion to Zelishkar, and encouragement not to give up with imprisonment. Before receiving the torches, Najkurm fought reluctantly and without direction, but the letter brought him enlightenment. His disdain for being forced to fight in the arena turned to gleeful anticipation, and the anxiety over crowd judgement became bliss.
    - The conversation when Najkurm's old partners in crime sneak in to the gladiators' quarters. T = Thug
        T: "Najkurm! pack your stuff up, we're getting you out of here"
        N: "I don't understand"
        T: "We're breaking you out! we have a plan to sneak you out"
        N: "But every guard and most of the citizens here know my face. they know my voice."
        T: "It's okay, we're leaving the city. we can restart our lives elsewhere. we snagged a wagon and a couple horses"
        N: "Oh! I think there's a misunderstanding. You sad fools still have no direction, and you're clinging to me. I'm in heaven here. Everyone loves me! Everyone fears me!"
        T: "You're still a slave to them, but we're free! Don't you want to be free? It's not the best on the streets, but you don't have masters who control your life."
        N: "Not the best? Ha, hahaha. If you aren't LOVING what you do, you are in the *wrong field*."
        - and Najkurm continues to cackle as he hops down into his bed and kicks back, with the thug-bros scurrying out of here before the commotion attracts attention.

## Descriptions
- Torch-Maces
    - This pair of cold iron batons is inscribed with depictions of the demigod Zelishkar, running the length between the leather grips and the spiral cages at the tips. When these cages are stuffed with oil-soaked rags and lit, the batons burn brightly, and hold a fire even through violent movement or impact. These are essentially masterwork torches, and thus only come into their own when wielded by one trained as a Torch Fighter.

## Quest Log
- Task: Break out in a grand spectacle. Set the whole colusseum ablaze, and pave a roaring trail of fire as you terrorize the city.
