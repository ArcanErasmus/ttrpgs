- Ideas for more damage/attacks
    - two-weapon fighting
    - sap adept/master
        - available weapons: dagger, kerambit, kukri, punching daggers, starknife, or swordbreaker dagger
        - https://aonprd.com/TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Blade%20of%20Mercy
            - Kukri is slashing
        - Nonlethal: 1d3 + Str + 10d8 + 11 = 58   + Str
        - Lethal:    1d3 + Str + 5d8       = 24.5 + Str
        - Weapon Versatility https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/weapon-versatility-combat
- Opportunities Aplenty https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/archetypes/rite-publishing-rogue-archetypes/vicious-opportunist
    - need: crits, more dice
    - cestus + improved crit, sap adept, sap master, 5 dice
        - 17-20/x2, 1d3 + Str + 20 + 10 = 32+Str nl, crit 64+2xStr nl
    - torch time
        - meriful, 1d4 + 1d6 + Str + 10 + 21 fire = 16+Str nl + 21 fire = ~37+Str total
        - double attack = 32+2xStr nl + 42 fire = ~74+2xStr total
