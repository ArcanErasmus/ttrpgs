### Dancing Lights - evocation [light]
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | medium
| Effect     | Up to four lights, all within a 10 ft radius area
| Duration   | 1 min (D)
| Save       | none
| SR         | no
Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o’-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The *dancing lights* must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell’s range.

You can only have one *dancing lights* spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent, it does not count against this limit.

*Dancing lights* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

### Ghost Sound - illusion (figment)
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S,M (a bit of wool or wax)
| Range      | close
| Effect     | Illusory sounds
| Duration   | 1 rd/lvl
| Save       | Will disbelief
| SR         | no
*Ghost sound* allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound *ghost sound* creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound’s basic character.

The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 40 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a *ghost sound* spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 32 humans. Anyone who hears a *ghost sound* receives a Will save to disbelieve.

*Ghost sound* can enhance the effectiveness of a *silent image* spell.

*Ghost sound* can be made permanent with a *permanency* spell.

### Prestidigitation - universal
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | 10 ft
| Target     | see text
| Duration   | 1 hr
| Save       | see text
| SR         | no
Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a *prestidigitation* spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. *Prestidigitation* can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a *prestidigitation* spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, *prestidigitation* lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

### Speak With Animals - divination
|------------|--------------
| Casting    | 1 standard action
| Components | V,S
| Range      | personal
| Target     | you
| Duration   | 1 min/lvl
You can ask questions of and receive answers from animals, but the spell doesn’t make them any more friendly than normal. Wary and cunning animals are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones make inane comments. If an animal is friendly toward you, it may do some favor or service for you.
